122. forma: ablative.

123. honesta ac liberali:
“ respectable and ladylike.'’
Liberalis gets the meaning “ gen-
tlemanly, ladylike” from the
contrast with servilis.

124. esse: for the omission
of the subject, see on dictum
(29)-

125. percussit expresses more
surprise and anxiety than Eng-
lish “it struck me.'’

126. lacrumae: usually
spelled lacrimae in classical
Latin. The sound of the
vowel of the penult was prob-
ably between the sounds of u
and i (cf. French u and German
ἅ). Α similar variation occurs
in lubet, libet ‚· optumus, optimus ,-
volumus‚ regimus, and in many
other words.

127. quorsum evadas: indi-
rect question after timeo.

Ibi tum exanimatus Pampilus

128. sepulcrum is often used
of the place where the body is
burned.

131. satis cum periclo: “ with
some risk‚” but not enough to
justify Pampilus' fright if he
had not been in love. Peri-
clum contains the stem seen
in ex-peri-or‚ “ try, test,’' and
peri-tus, ‘⁴ having tried, experi-
mented,'’ and its meaning was
originally the same as that of
ex-peri-mentum‚ “ trial, test.'’
The classica} periculum comes
from this by the development
of a short vowel between c and
l, much as English “athletic'’
sometimes comes to be pro-
nounced “ atheletic.'1 In other
words, too, early Latin often dif-
fers from classical Latin in the
form of this suffix; Plautus and
Terence have vehiclum from veho,
cubiclum from cubo, poclum for
