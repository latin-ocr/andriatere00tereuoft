INTROD UCTION

to save one of the victims and send word by him to her kins-
men in Greece. Orestes insists that he will be the victim of
the goddess, and⁴ that Pylades shall return home. Before
giving him the tablet, Iphigenia binds him by an oath to
deliver her letter.

But stay: there is one chance we have forgot.

A new oath can be sworn, if this serve not.

In one case set me free. Say I be crossed
With shipwreck‚ and„ with ship and tablet lost
And all I bear, my life be saved alone:

Let not this oath be held a thing undone, v
To curse me. Iph. Nay, then, many ways are best
To many ends. The words thou carriest
Enrolled and hid beneath that tablet's rim,

I will repeat to thee, and thou to him

For thy sake and for mine 'tis fairer so.

Now let me hear his name to whom I go

In ArgoliS, and how my words should run.
Say: “To Orestes, Agamemnon’s son,

She that was slain in Aulis, dead to Greece
Yet quick, Iphigenia sendeth peace :''
Iphigenia ! Where ? Back from the dead ?
’Tis I. But speak not, lest thou break my thread. —·
“Take me to Argos, brother, ere I die,

Back from the Friendless Peoples and the high
Altar of her whose bloody rites I wreak.''

[Asida] Where am I, Pylades ? How shall I speak ? - ἐ

“Else one in grief forsaken shall, like shame,

Haunt thee.’' Pyl. [Aside.] Orestes! Iph. [Over- ,

hearing him] Yes: that is the name. “ -
Ye gods above ! Iph. Why callest thou on god
For words of mine ? Pyl. 'Tis nothing. 'Twa's a road
