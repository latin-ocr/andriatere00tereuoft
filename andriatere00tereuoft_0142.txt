AcT IV SCENE 1

625. hoccinest: for hoccine,
see on 186. For the quantity
of ‘ez-t, see Introduction 19
end. Cretic words (.-υ-)
often have their final syllable
shortened in Plautus’ anapaests
and occasionally in his dactyls.
This one tetrameter is the only
dactylic line in Terence, and he
uses no anapaests at all. For
the contrasting usage in iambic
and trochaic rhythm, see on
veritus sum (582); but compare
hoccinffst in iambic rhythm in line
236. — memorabile : “ capable of
being described.’'

626 ff.. For the cretic tetram-
eters, see Introduction 28.

· 138

626. 'ut siet is a substantive
clause of result in apposition
with hoccine (625).

627. The subject of gaudeant
is the same as the antecedent
of quoiquam. Carinus shifts
from a singular form of expres-
sion with quisquam “anyone”
to a (nearly) equivalent plural
expression. For the psycho-
logical process involved in such
contamination‚ see on quin dic
(45)-

628. alterius, like ullius, etc.‚
is regular except in dactylic
verse, where it is impossible.

629. For the scansion of this
line, see Introduction 28. —

verum: “justss' — immo: “ no
indeed ἔ ”
