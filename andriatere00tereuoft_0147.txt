680. vel, “ or, if you like,'’
introduces the alternative to
tuomst . . . ignoscere (678). -—
missum face is somewhat
stronger than mitte or omitte.

Such periphrases are particu- -

larly common in colloquial
Latin; compare inventum dabo
(683) and inventum curabo
(684). The original forms
face, dice, and duce are occa-
sionally used by Plautus and
Terence. For the loss of the
short final vowel, see on in-
tellextin (201) and poste (509).

682. crepuit: the noise of
an opening door is often re-
ferred to in the comedies as
indicating that some one is
about to come from a house.
Compare Introduction page 29.

The i of the third person singu-
lar perfect is ostem-long in early
Latin and occasionally in later
poetry. It was originally short,
but was sometimes lengthened
under the influence of the first
person.

683. nihil ad te: sc. attinet.
—quaerot sc. consilium. —
nuncin: nunc is from num
(compare tum, tunc “ then ”)
and the demonstrative particle
ce. For the change of ce to ci
before the interrogative particle,
see on hoccine (186).
