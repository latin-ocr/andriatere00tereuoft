‘Quid feci ? Quid commerui aut peccavi, pater ?

Servavi)

Honesta oratiost.

So. Recte putas;

Nam si illum obiurges, vitae qui auxilium tulit,
Quid facias illi, qui dederit damnum aut malum ?

Si.

Venit Cremes postridie ad me clamitans:

Indignum facinus l Comperisse, Pampilum
Pro uxore habere hanc peregrinam. Ego illud sedulo

139. commerui: the verb
properly means “ earn,” but
where the thing earned is a
punishment English idiom re-
quires that we say “ deserve.”

14ο. prohibui: sc. eam.

141. oratio here and often
has the meaning “ plea,” which
accords with the common mean-
ing of the parent verb oro. If,
as is probable‚ oro is a deriva-
tive of os, “ mouth,’' oro orig-
inally meant “ speak,'' and
oratio, “ speech.”

143. quid facias ini: “ What
In-
stead of an indirect object of
facio in this sense, Terence
usually employs an' ablative
of means, as in quid me faciam
(614). — damnum: ‘⁶ loss '’ of
property. — malum: “ injury ''
to the person.

145. indignum facinus: the
accusative in exclamations is
very common in colloquial

, Latin. — comperisse: for the
TER. Annam—6

omission of the subject se, see
on dictum (29).

145 f. Cremes blames Pam-
pilus chiefly for regarding
a foreign woman as virtu-
ally his wife. Athenian law
strictly forbade the marriage
of citizens with foreigners,
and public opinion censured
a permanent connection with a
foreign woman. A temporary
intrigue between a young
Athenian and such a woman,
on the other hand, was not
thought blameworthy at all.

It will be important to remember·

this sharp difference between
ancient and modern feeling in
reading the rest of the play.
We may well disapprove of the
ancient point of view, but we
cannot justly blame Terence, or
Menander, or their characters
for exhibiting the usual ethics
of their times.

146. ego illud: shortened by v

the iambic law.
