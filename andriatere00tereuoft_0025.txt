INTROD UCTI ΟΝ 2 Ι

My thoughts had turned. Speak on. —— No need
for us

To question: we shall hear things marvelous.

Tell him that Artemis my soul did save,

I wot not how, and to the altar gave

A fawn instead3 the which my father slew,

Not seeing‚ deeming that the sword he drew

Struck me. But she had borne me far away

And left me in this land. — I charge thee, say

So much. It all is written on the scroll.

An easy charge thou layest on my soul,

A glad oath on thine own. I wait no more,

But here fulfill the service that I swore.

Orestes, take this tablet which I bear

To thine own hand, thy sister's messenger.

I take it, but I reck not'of its scrip

Nor message. Too much joy is at my lip.

Sister! Beloved l Wildered though I be,

My arms believe not, yet they crave for thee.

Now, filled with wonder, give me my delight l
[He goes to embrace her. She stands speechless]

Stranger‚ forbear! No living man hath right

To touch that robe. The goddess were defiled !

O sister mine, Ο my dead father's child,

Agamemnon’s child; take me and have no fear,

Beyond all dreams 'tis I thy brother here.

My brother? Thou? . . . Peacel Mock at me
no more.

Argos is bright with him and Nauplia's shore.

Unhappy one ! Thou hast no brother there.

Orestes . . . thou? Whom Clytemnestra bare?

To Atreus’ first-born son, thy sire and mine.

Thou sayst it: oh, give me some proof, some sign l

What sign thou wilt. Ask anything from home.
