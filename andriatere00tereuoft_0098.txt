ANCILLA

[Calls through the door to an older woman within]
Afidivi‚ Arculis, iam dudum: Lesbiam adduci iubes.
Sane pol illa tsemulemast mulier et temeraria

Nec satis digna, quoi committas primo partu mulierem. e
[Closes the door, and soliloquizes.]

Tamen eam adducam.

inportunitatem spectate aniculae,

Quia compotrix eius est.

Di, date facilitatem obsecro 5

Huic pariundi atque illi in aliis potius peccandi locum.

[Sees Pampilus approaching]

Sed quid nam Pampilum exanimatum video? Vereor

quid siet.

Opperiar, ut sciam num quid nam haec turba tristitiae

adferat.

AcT II SCENE 3

228 ff. For the trochaic septe-
narii, see Introduction 24 and 25.
228. Arculis: the classical

form would be Archylis (Gk.
Ἀρχυλῖς).

229. pt'il ma: for the-scan-
sion, see Introduction 19.—
temulenta: this epithet pre-
pares the way for compotrix
(232), and thus provides a
motive for Arculis' insisting
that Lesbia be employed. It
appears, however, that Lesbia
is not in her cups this morning.
The second epithet, temeraria,
is amply justified by the mid-
wife⁹s behavior when she arrives.

231. aniculae: the diminu-

[W ithdraws to the rear of the stage]

tive expresses contempt, as
diminutives often do,

233. pariundi: —und- for -end-
in the gerund and gerundive of

the third and fourth conjuga· · '

tions is more common in early
than in classical Latin. Prob-
ably u was the original vowel,
while e was brought in by the
influence of the present active
participle. — aliis is feminine.
234. exanimatum: “ out of
breath.'’ -sietz in addition
to the classical forms of the
present subjunctive of sum,

*early Latin had also the longer

forms siem, siis, siet, siZ’mus,

siitis, sient. They were going

out of use in Terence's day.
235. turba: “agitation.'’
