178 APPENDIX

483. BC² DEG: sac istaec ut lavet ‚· C¹P‚ Donat., Edd.: ista ,·
Schol. Bemb. Ad. 3. 4. 36, Fleckeisen, Fairclough: istam. The
active lavet seems absurd, since Glucerium was in no condition to
help herself. Menander, at any rate, did not make her attend to her
own needs; for his text, as recorded by Donatus, was λούσατ’
αὐτὴν αὐτίκα. The passive lavetur, which originally stood here,
was, we may suppose, understood by some scribe as a middle form3
hence he carelessly substituted lavet. It is probable that istaec is
the correct form of the pronoun; for the copyists would be more
likely to change this to ista than vice versa. The retention of is·
taec compels us to omit ut. The reading lavetur makes unnecessary
Fleckeisen’s alteration of post to postes (Engelbrecht, W ien.
Stud. 5. 218, avoided poste by employing lavetur as a middle form.)
If the molossus in the fourth foot of a bacchiac tetrameter is held to
be impossible (see Lindsay, The Captivi of Plautus page 83), one
may read: fac istam ut lavbnt; poste deinde.

512. With much hesitation I have adopted Fleckeisen’s faciam
instead of the facio of the Mss. Possibly a misunderstanding of the
archaic qui induced some copyist to change the mood of the verb.
The alternative is to read quis.

527. The Mss. are divided between ipse and ipsus. The form
which was less familiar to the copyists is likely to have been the
original. The fact that Terence sometimes chose ipsus for metrical
reasons is not evidence that he avoided it wherever ipse would serve
as well.

596. So Mss. The proceleusmatic, corrtg‘efr} mihi, seems to be
without an exact parallel, but nevertheless Klotz, Altrb'mische
Metrik 268, is inclined to prefer this to the transposition which
Fleckeisen proposed in his first edition. Spengel's corrigi is scarcely
Latin; the infinitive with subject accusative after enitor ought to be
in indirect discourse as it is after nitor in Cic., Ac. 2. 21. 68 : Nitamur
igitur nihil poss? percipi. ,

599. So Bentley3 Mss.: quae tibi. ⁷ An accent on tibi is almost
inevitable in view of the contrast with illi. Terence was fond of
putting a connective immediately before its verb; but later usage
favored the transposition which appears in our manuscripts. Com-
pare my note on ut (160).
