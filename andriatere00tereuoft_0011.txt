PREFACE . 7

As already imphed, the editor is under great obligation to
F airclough’s excellent edition of the Andria. He has also

⁸ taken not a little from Ashmore and from the standard

German editions. Thanks are also due to the publishers of
Capps’ From Homer to Theocritus (Scribners, New York)
and of Murray's translation of the Iphigenia in the Land
of the Taurians (George Allen, London), as well as to the
authors themselves, for permission to reprint extracts from
those books. Professor Capps had the kindness to read
most of the Introduction in manuscript, and he made
several valuable suggestions. Professor Knapp subjected
the entire manuscript to a searching criticism‚ which led in
some cases to a change of opinion and in very many others to
a clearer statement of the view previously adopted. There
is scarcely a page of the commentary that has not been
improved in one way or the other. He has also read most of

the proof.
