PROLOGUS

Contaminari n6n decere fabulas,

Faciuntne intellegendo, ut nihil intellegant ?

Qui quom hunc accusant, Naevium Plautum Ennium
Accusant, quos hic noster auctores habet,

Quorum aemulari exoptat neclegentiam

Potius quam istorum obscuram diligentiam.

Dehinc sit quiescant porro moneo et desinant

Male dicere, malefacta ne noscant sua.

16. contaminari: “ to be
mixed,” as Menander's Andria
and Perinthia were mixed to
form Terence’s Andria (see
Introduction 15).

17. faciantne really means
“do they or do they not?'’
Classical Latin, however, would
surely use nonne here, and
English idiom also requires “ do
they not.'' —faciuntne . . .
intellegant: “ Do they not
with all their knowing really
know nothing? '' or, better,
“ Do they with all their know-
ing really know anything? ’'

18. Naevium Plautum En-
nium: for Plautus, see Intro-
duction 8. Naevius was an
earlier contemporary of Plau-
tus who wrote comedies and
tragedies, and, late in life,
an epic poem on the war with

‘Carthage‚ from which Vergil

is said to have borrowed not a
little. Ennius was a younger

· contemporary of Plautus who

TER. ANmuA — 5

wrote plays, but who is best
known for his epic poem on the
history of Rome from the land—
ing of AEneas in Italy down to
the poet's own day. This was
regarded as the greatest Roman
epic until the appearance of
Vergil’s AEneid. ἱ

19. hic noster: sc. poeta,· see
on 1. — auctores: “ examples‚
models.’'

20. neclegentiam: “ careless
freedom,'' in the sense in which
we speak of a “ free translation.''
But perhaps we should translate
“ carelessness‚'’ and think of this
and diligentiam in the next line
as quoted from Lanuvinus.

21. obscuram diligentiam:
“ obscure literalism‚'’ or perhaps
“ obscure accuracy.”

22. dehinc: for the pro-
nunciation, see on 79. — dehinc
porro: “ from now on.''

23. malefacta: originally a .
phrase, male factum,· see on
maledictis (7).
