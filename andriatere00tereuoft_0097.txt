‘Ffiit olim hinc quidam

Navem is fregit apud Andrum insulam3
Ibi tum hanc eiectam Crfisidis

Patrem rec6pisse orbam, parvam. Fabulae l
Mihi quidem hercle non fit veri simile3 atque ipsis

commentum placet.

[Musis appears at the door of Gluqerium's house]
Sed Musis ab ea egreditur. At ego hinc me ad forum,

Ut

Conveniam Pfimpssfim, ne de hac re pater inprudentem

opprimat.

221. civem Atticam esse
hanc: there was a law in Athens
that the seducet of a respecta-
ble girl of the citizen class
must marry her. —- olim: “ once
on a time.'' — hinc, “ from
here‚'' is virtually equivalent to
Atticus‚· translate “ of this
city.’'

222. navem is fregit is a less
exact expression for navis ei
fracta est. ’

223. The repetition of is is
characteristic of colloquial style.
—obiit mortem: in Andros,
some time after the shipwreck.

224. fabulae: “ fairy tales Ξ ”

225. atque frequently occurs
in early Latin in the proper

[Exit ri ght.]

etymological sense of at-que,
“ and on the other hand, and
yet,'' 1 a meaning that was later

confined to atqui. For the lat-
ter, see on qui (53).
226. ab ea: “ from her

(Glucerium's) house ''; cf. apud
me, “at my house,'' ad me,
“to my house,''—me: sc.
conferam‚· the ellipsis is collo-
quial. —forum in Terence is
a translation of Greek ἀγορά,
and must be rendered into Eng-
lish by “ market '’; the English
word “ forum '' inevitably sug-
gests the Forum Romanum,
226 f. ut conveniam Pam-
pilum: for the order, see on ut

(160).

¹Many scholars reject this obvious etymology of atque on account of-
the common meaning. Perhaps the word combines original at-que and

ad-que.
