2. Hic cum multis nobilibus familiariter vixit, sed maxime cum
Scipione Africano et C. Laelio, quibus etiam corporis gratia con-
ciliatus existimatur. Quod et ipsum Fenestella arguit contendens
utroque maiorem natu fuisse, quamvis et Nepos aequales omnes
fuisse tradat et Porcius suspicionem de consuetudine per haec

faciat :

2. Scipione Africano: the
younger Africanus, the con-
queror of Carthage‚ born 185 or

184 B.C. He was the center of
a band of literary men who
encouraged the newly intro-
duced Hellenic culture at Rome.
It is sometimes stated that
Terence drew much of his inspi-
ration from this “ Scipionic
Circle,'' but it is not likely that

Scipio had gathered many prom-
inent men about him at the time

when Terence began writing3
for Scipio was then not more
'than seventeen years old (see
on Caecilio‚§3,and nondum . . .
annum, ἓ 5).

C. Laelio: Gaius Laelius
Sapiens, the younger, born 186
13.c. He and Africanus are the
young men with whom Cicero
makes Cato discuss old age in
the De Senectute. Their friend-
ship is commemorated in the
same author's De Amicitia.

corporis gratia: “ by the
charm of his person.” Love
affairs with boys were scarcely
considered shameful among the

Greeks. Roman feeling was
nearer our own.

con'ciliatus : “ endeared.''

3. et ipsum literally means
“ itself also‚'' but comes to be
little more than a variant of
quoque. The idiom is common
in Livy and later prose.

arguit: “confutes’' In this
case, as in the other, Fenestella
was certainly right3 see on
‘nondum . . . annum (ξ 5).

4. Nepos: Cornelius Nepos,
a friend of Cicero and Catullus,
a rather careless and inaccurate
biographer. From his works
twenty-five brief biographies
have come down to us.

aequales: “ of the same age.''
As a matter of fact, Terence was
about ten years older than Scipio
and Laelius (see ξ 5).

5. Porcius: Porcius Licinus,
in the first century B.C., wrote
in verse a history of Roman
literature. This is not the only
chronological mistake to be
found in the few extant frag-
ments of his work.

consuetudine ε “ intimacy.''
