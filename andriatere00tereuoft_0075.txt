(classical nati) shows the initial
g which was permanently re-
tained in co-gnatus.

51. nam: “well then.'’——
epebis = classical Latin ephebis.
In ea'rly times, when the Romans
borrowed Greek words they
did not take pains to pronounce
accurately the unfamiliar Greek
aspirates, χ (ch, pronounced
nearly as ckh in blockkouse),
φ (ph, as in haphazard), and θ
(th, as in boathouse). Instead
they used the nearest equiva-
lents their own language fur-
nished‚ namely, c, p, and t,
respectively. It was not until
after Terence’s time that edu-
cated Romans began to take
their Greek more seriously and
to pronounce and write the
Ιι which followed the mute
in such words. Epebi were
young men from 18 to 20, during
which years they served in the
militia. The line means “ after
he carne of age.”

53. qui: an early Latin
ablative of quis or qui. The
relative-interrogative belongs to
the first and second declension
in some of its forms (e.g.‚ nom.

pl. qui, quae, gen. pl. quorum,
quarum), but in others it is an
i-stem of the third declension
(e.g.‚ qicis, quem, quibus). Be-
sides the ablative quo, qua,
quo, early Latin possessed also
the i-stem ablative qui (pre-
served in the classical phrases
qui-cum, (lt-qui, etc.) which
served for all three genders.
The form qui ,was used not only
in all the senses of the other
form, but also in several ad-
verbial uses. Very frequently
it means “ how,'' interrogative
(as here), indefinite, or relative.
In the sense of “ why '’ (which
occurs in lines 150, 934, 954,
etc.) it combines with the old
negative ηέ (= non) to form
quin (cf. on 45).—posses:
the mood is due entirely to the
indefinite second person; Ter-
ence might have written quis-
quam poterat. The tense is
the same as that of prohibebant,
and for the same reason.

54. magister: here, as in
Phormio 72, the word is the
equivalent of the Greek loan
word paedagogus (παιδαγω-
γός), the designation of the
