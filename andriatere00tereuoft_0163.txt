821. face: for the form, see
on 680.

822. vitam: for the case, see
on in quibus (758).

823. immo enim: enim is
corroborative; translate “ why,
no ! '’ —nunc quom maxume:
this common phrase means
“ now as much as ever.” The
expression must originally have
been somewhat fuller, but it is
impossible to determine just
what has been omitted; per-

haps we should supply ita ut

159

as is suggested by Cicero, Ad
Quint. Frat. 2. 4. 6 (2. 6. 6):
domus celebratur ita ut cum
maxime.

824. An antithesis between
words and deeds is much more
common in Greek than in Latin ;
no doubt Menander employed
it here.—dudum is used as in
582. ,

825. prae sometimes has a
causal force in a negative sen-
tence, “ in view of, from.”

826. modum: “ the limits.”

827. remittas: ‘⁴ cease.” —
iniuriis: “ unjust demands.”
