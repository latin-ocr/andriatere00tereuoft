of the name would be Chrysis
(Gk. Χρυσίς); cf. on sum-
bolam (88).

86. teneo: “I get you.”

88. Pampilus: the classical
form would be Pamphilus (Gk.
Πάμφιλος). - sumbolam : the
classical form would be sym-
bolam. The letters Y and Z do
not occur in genuine Latin
words, and in Terence's day
they were not used at all in
Latin; Greek Υ and Z were
represented by Latin U and SS
(or S), respectively. At a later
time, when the Romans began
to write PH for Greek Φ, etc.
(see on epebis‚¹ 51) they also
introduced the characters Y
and .Z. The word sumbola
means “ contribution‚'' and here
designates a payment toward
the expense of a dinner. T er-
ence keeps the Greek word which
he found in Menander; in his

day, probably, no Latin word
would suggest the Greek custom.
Cicero, however, uses conlecta

· in precisely this sense.

90. nil quicquam: a pleo-
nasm common in colloquial
Latin.

91. enim vero: “ in fact'’;
enim is common in early Latin
without causal force. Enim is
shortened by the iambic law.

93. ingeniis shows the shift
of meaning which is familiar
in the English word “ character ”
= “a person of distinctive
characteristics.'' — eius: a
monosyllable pronounced eis
with diphthongal ei. This is
probably the original genitive
of is. It went out of use soon
after Terence's time. Our man-
uscripts always spell eius and it
seems best to follow them. In
case an ictus falls upon the
monosyllabic genitive eius, it is
