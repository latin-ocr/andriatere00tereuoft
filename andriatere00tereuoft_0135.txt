· SERvos Ι SENEX SENEX

[Enter Davos from Simo's house]

Da. [To Simo]

Da. Cur uxor n6n accersitur? Iam advesperascit.

Ad te ibam.. Si. Quid namst?

Si.

[A part to Cremes.] Audin ?

[To Davos.] Ego dudum non nil veritus ssim, Dave,
abs te, ne faceres idern,

Quod volgus servorum solet, dolis ut me deludereS,

579. adeo: “too.''

580. eccum: for the form
and meaning, see on 532.—
foras is the accusative of a
noun *sorae, equivalent to fores,
“ door.” The accusative of the
end of motion, foras, “ out of
doors‚” and the locative abla-
t'ive‚ foris, were the only cases
of the word that survived.

Acr III Sel-:NE 10

581. accersitur: for the
meaning, see on 546. —— adves-
perascit: the wedding pro-
cession started about sunset.

582. dudum: “ a while
ago ''; i.e., at the close of their
last interview, in line 523.—
veritfis sum: the short ultima
is probably due, not to the iam-

bic law, which does not very
often shorten the final syllable
of a trisyllable‚ but to the weak
pronunciation in early Latin
of final s after a short vowel
when the next word begins with
a consonant. There is abun-
dant evidence of this peculiarity
outside of the dramatists‚ and
in Plautus and Terence there
are a number of passages where
final 'syllables of this type have
to be scanned short although
the conditions of the iambic
law are not fulfilled. In many
other cases, as patris pudor
(262), magis lubido (308), either
method of shortening or both
of them may be involved.

583. volgus servorum:
“the common run of slaves.'’
