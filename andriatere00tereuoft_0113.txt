in the first scene of the second
act.

355. continuo, etc„ refers to
Davos' exit after line 227.

356. ibi: “ then.” — quen-
dam excelsum locum: no doubt
Menander named the hill; but,
for the benefit of his Roman
audience, Terence substituted
a phrase which could be under-
stood without a knowledge of the
topography of Athens.

359. re: “ circumstances ”3
the most important of them are
listed in the next line.
the word ob-
sonium is the Greek ὀψώνιον,

- “ marketing, day’s purchase of

supplies.'' In Plautus and Ter-

ence it rarely if ever corresponds
to Greek ὄψον, “ fish, sauce, refi-
ish,” as the dictionaries say it
does. —ipsusz this early Latin
form is less common in Terence
than ipse. For the meaning of
the word, see on ipsa (265).

361. non cohaerent: “ it
doesn't hang together.'' Eng-
lish idiom prefers a singular,
Latin a plural, to refer to a story.
— quorsum: for the verb to be
supplied, cf. 127. —Crememz
for the form, see on 247.

362. illo, an adverb of direc-
tion, shows the same termina-
tion as quo, e0‚ etc. Early and
colloquial Latin have also illo-c,

as well as the classical illuc. —
id: for the case, see A. & G.
