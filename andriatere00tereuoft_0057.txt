INTRoD UCTION 5 3

The early Romans were subject to this same tendency, so
much so, in fact, that certain originally iambic words had
their final syllables permanently shortened. Eg& was on'ce
b‘gb like Greek ἐγώ; the adverbs bbn? and meil? originally
ended in long ἒ, as do other adverbs from adjectives of the
first and second declensions; m5d5‚ -the adverb, is really
the ablative singular of modus; the datives mihi, tibi, s'ibi,
and the adverbs ibi and abi, originally had a long final syl-
lable, a pronunciation which was frequently employed by
Vergil and other classical poets, but which in their day may
no longer have been heard in ordinary speech.

In the time of Plautus and Terence the‘tendency to shorten
a long syllable after a short was much more widespread than
the traces of the process in classical Latin would lead us to
suppose. Thus, a syllable long by position might be short-
ened (dabit nemo) ; the two syllables might belong to different
words (ἕι id gratum, &go ἶη portu, sine invidia), or they might
form only part of a word (vb‘lic‘ptati). An accent following the
long syllable of an iambus had the same effect 'as one preced-
ing it (vb‘lz‘c‘ptcz'ti, padicitia).¹ The tendency of early Latin to
shorten long syllables may, then, be summed up in these
two formulas:

(a) (J— tended to become (a υ

(b) υ —L tended to become υ υᾼ

υ υ

The tendency was not equally strong in all words, The
common words which regularly show the shortening in later
times (see above) appear usually to have been pronounced
with this shortening in the early period, although, in the case
of most of them, there are sure instances of the original form
(note eg5‚ Andria 258, 7023 mod5‚ 630, ete.). Other wordS,
such as bon5s, patris, regularly retained the long quantity;
