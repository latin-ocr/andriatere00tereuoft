ACTUS IV, SCENA III

149

Non apposisse — ut liquido possim. Mu. [Ironically]

Intellego ;

Nova nfinc religio in te istaec incessit.

Cedo.

Da. Move ocius te, ut quid agam porro intellegas.
[M usis lays the baby at Simo’s door.]

Pro Iuppiter! Mu. Quid est?

intervenit.

Da. Sponsae pater

Repudio quod consilium pri'mum intenderam.

Mu. Nescio quid narres.
- Venire me adsimulabo.

Da. Ego quoque hinc ab dextera
Τι’] ut subservias„
Orationi, utquomque opus sit, verbis vide.

[Exit left.]

Mu. Ego quid agas nihil intelleg63 sed si quid est,
Quod mea opera opus sit vobis, sit tu plus vides,
Manebo, ne quod vostrum remorer commodum.

⁸729. apposisse: in earlyLatin

the perfect of pono (from *po- “

sino) is po-sivi (here contracted).
The classical posui was formed
to match the perfect passive-po-
situs sum on the model of such
pairs as monui, monitus sum,· do-
mui, domitus sum; etc. —liquido ε
“ with a clear conscience.”

730. religio: “ scruple.'’ ——
cedo: for form and meaning,
see on 150.

731. porro, “ further‚'’ is to
be construed with agam.

732. Iuppiter is a vocative.
For the use of pro, see on 237. —
sponsae pater: i.e.,.Cremes. —-
intervenit: “is coming in the
midst <of our preparations>.’'

733. consilium primum : what
the original plan was we can

only conjecture. Probably Da-
vos meant to inform Simo that a
baby had been laid at his door.

734. dextera: cf. dextram
(289). The longer forms of
this word are more common in
early Latin than later. Cremes
is coming from his house, which
lies to the right. So Davos
starts off in the opposite direc-
tion, goes around the block, and
appears from the right as if he
were following Cremes at some
distance.

735. ut subservias depends
on vide. >

736. utquomque = utcumque.
—verbist ablative of means with
subservias.

738. quod: accusative of re-
spect.
