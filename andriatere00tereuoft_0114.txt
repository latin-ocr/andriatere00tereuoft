363 ff. Observe how differ-
ently the two lovers react to
Davos' news.

364. matronam nullam in
aedibus: the Roman audience
would no doubt interpret these
words as referring to the pro-
nuba, the married woman who
acted as the bride’s attendant
at a Roman wedding. Terence,
however, probably took the
phrase from Menander, who
was alluding to the fact that a
wedding was the one social
occasion in which Athenian
women took a prominent part.

365, ornati: in Plautus and
Terence, nouns of the fourth
declension often have -i, less
often -uis‚ in the genitive. The
former ending comes from the

second declension and the latter
from the third. The classical
ending -τῖς, which is also found
in early Latin, is the original
ending of u-stems.

367. narras: used colloqui-
ally for dicis.

368. certa res estg “ It’s a ,

sure thing.” — puerum: for the
meaning, see on puer (84).—
Cremi: for the form, see on
247.

369. An Athenian wedding in·-
volved feasting at the homes of
both bride and groom. Com-
pare Introduction pp. 35 f.—
pisciculos minutos: the tau-
tological diminutive is colloquial.
- ferre: historical infinitive. —
obolo: the Attic obol was in-
trinsically worth about three
cents, but the purchasing power
of money was very much greater
then than it is now.
