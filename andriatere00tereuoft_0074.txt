early Latin, words of four sylla-
bles,the first three of which were
all short, were regularly accented
on the first; so pilosopos (57),
mu'lieres (117), etc. In Cicero's
day contracted genitives like
benefici and consili were accented
on the penult, but early Latin
verse indicates that at that time
they followed the same accentual
laws as other words.

45. quin dic : quin (qui, “ why”
-Ι- -ηέ, “not '') with the indica-
tive often conveys a suggestion
that is virtually a command ε
e.g., Quin taces? (399) “ Why
don’t you hush ?'' The use with
the imperative is due to the con-
tamination of two synonymous
expressions. One sometimes
starts to say, “ Why did you do
that ?'' but thinks of the equiva-
lent and partly identical ques-
tion, “ What did you do that
for ?'' and ends by saying “Why
did you do that for? '' Just so
one sometimes started to say
quin dicis? but, thinking of the
equivalent dic, he ended by say-
ing quin dic.— quid est: in early

Latin, indirect questions often
take the indicative, especially in
connection with an imperative.
Some scholars prefer to say that
such questions are not really de-
pendent.-—quod is a secondary
object of velis ,· see A. δι (3.390 d,
B. 178.1 d, Bu. 510, G. 341. 2, H.
& B. 397, H. 412, L. δι Μ. 524.

47. quas credis esse has:
quas = quales (the antecedent is
verae). Although has and nup-
tiae logically belong together,
they stand in different clauses
and each takes the case proper
to its own clause. English idiom
requires that they be brought
together: “This is not a real
marriage, as you consider it to
be‚'' or better, ‘⁴ Though you
consider it such, this is not a
real marriage.” As appears la-
ter (lines 238 f., 253 ff.), Simo
has not yet informed his house-
hold that the marriage is set
for to-day; but it has been
necessary to explain to Sosia the
unusually liberal marketing‘.
