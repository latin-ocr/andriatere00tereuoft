Andriast in the Mss.). Meretrix is needed to give Cremes a clue to
Musis’ identity. The undeserved insult in it would hardly fail to
draw a retort from Musis, and so Ι assign 757 f. to her instead of to
Davos as the Mss. do. Compare note ad loc.

772. Mss. : cuius. This is said to be the only case in Terence of
the dissyllabic genitive of qui. There is no doubt‚· however, that
the form was in common use; and so it is quite unnecessary to read
quoia here.

787. So Mss. (credes, DP). Fleckeisen's attempt to dismiss
non credas as a “solecism’' (Neue Jahrb. 139. 844) is scarcely suc-
cessful. He does not explain how non got into our Mss. For
approximate parallels, see Bennett, Syntax of Early Latin 1. 170.

807. D: hucine appuli,· cett: huc me appuli‚· Priscian and one
of Bentley’s manuscripts: huc me attuli. It seems impossible to
explain the presence of appuli in our manuscripts if attuli was the
original form3 and yet me appuli is without „parallel (see Fairclough).
Ι think that huc me is a corruption of the emphatic hucine of D,
which is itself an early modification of huc.

816. δε libet ,· -γε licet. Crito is making a virtue of necessity,
and licet would destroy the point. Compare my note.

817. On the assignment of parts, see Spengel’s critical note, and
compare my note.

838. In the Mss. at stands at the beginning of the following line.
See Vahlen, Uber die V ersschlu'ssc in den Komb'dien des Terentius.

850. The reading in the text is Dziatzko's. I cannot agree with
Spengel and Fairclough when they hold that modo must be an em-
phatic word here. Davos is speaking against his will and does not
care to emphasize anything. Simo seizes upon the modo in his
reply, not because it is emphatic, but because it is the only new
element in Davos' statement. For iambic ego, see Appendix on 258.

854. So BDP; Edd.: audies. The subjunctive certainly occurs
after fax0,· e.g., Phor. 1028. See Bennett, Syntax of Early Latin Ι.
225 f.

864. For egb‘, see Appendix on 258.

909. So BDEGP2C²‚ Fleckeisen3 PCO, Edd. : qua re. The fuller
reading gives a better sense, and the corruption to qua reis very easy.

926. See Klotz, ad loc.
