850. ergo = quidem. —- ego
modo introii: “ Ijust (i.e., only)
went in.'' Davos is talking un-
der compulsion, and he doesn't in-
tend his words to give any infor-
mation. Simo, however, chooses
to take modo in its temporal
sense, “just now.''

851. By this time Simo's
anger is pretty evident and the
slave can think of no better plan
than to turn it away from him-
self upon his young master. ’

852. inter eos: the preposi-
tional phrase is accented as a
single word 3 see on apud me (36),
and Introduction 18.

853. illum: sc. hic esse, if
quid is the adverb “ why‚'' or
facere, if quid is the pronoun‚

854. faxo: for the form, see

on faxis (753).

855 ff. Davos means his de- -

scription to be complimentary.
He has recognized in Crito a
brother artist; in particular, he
sees the cash value of Crito’s

-long face and solemn ways.

355. ellum is a combination
of em and illum, with loss of the
initial vowel of the second word,
as in exprobratiost (44), etc.
For the case of the pronoun‚ see
on em (351). In use, ellum
stands to eccum (see on 532) as
ille stands to hic. Here it is
accompanied by a gesture to-
ward Glucerium's house; trans-
late “he's in there.'’--con-
fidens, “cheeky,” and catuS,
“sharp‚” are both slang; the
latter is a Sabine word.

856. quantivis preti: “ worth
any sum you please.'’

857. tristis: we might render
it by “ austere‚'' if we could
