APPENDIX 1 79

614. So D, and the reading is supported by the fact that the con-
text calls for an accent on me. P shows a repetition of the phrase,

nec quid me, with which the verse begins, and nec quidem me of the ,

other manuscripts is an attempted correction of that.

624. With some hesitation I follow Legrand's tentative sugges-
tion, Daos 486, in making this the end of an act, because I cannot
accept the alternative theory that lines 301-819, more than half

, the entire play, were unbroken by a musical interlude. The poet

 

has indeed provided a satisfactory motive for getting Pampilus
and Davos off the stage: they have a difficult task before them,
and the time for accomplishing it is short. On the other hand, it is
surprising to find the same two characters upon the stage again
eighteen lines below. The alternative supposition, however, that
Pampilus listened quietly to eighteen lines of undeserved insult
before making his confession, is not satisfactory. Leo, Der Mono-
log im Drama 57, points out that both this break and the one after
line 300 are followed by the appearance of Carinus, one of the
characters said to have ‚been added to the play by Terence3 per-
, haps the division into acts was clearer in Menander.

629. So Mss. and Reinhold Klotz. I cannot cite a parallel for
the third foot (ό υ υ υ -), but hesitate to make any of the violent
changes usually adopted. Richard Klotz, Altr5misclze Metrik
298, suggests h6minum genus pbssumum.

631. The Mss. except C and P read tempust, but Donatus com-
ments on the absence of est.

713. All the best Mss. assign the second si quid to Carinus; but
such a repetition seems inconsistent with his sanguine temperament.
Hence I adopt Spengel's conjecture.

751. The editors suppose that Musis' exclamation is due to
Davos' rough attempts to force her to the right and away from
Cremes. But any suchvstage business would be without motive
from Cremes’ point of view and therefore impossible. Davos has
to rely upon whispers to get Musis away from Cremes.

754. It is easier to suppose that Musis used male dicis inexactly
for comminaris than to make Davos postpone an indignant question
for a line and a half.

756. It is necessary to delete either meretrix or ancilla (after
