INTROD UCTION 49

Tert'enti num similEm dicetis quempiam?

Volcatius autem non solum Naevio et Plauto et Caecilio, sed

Licinio quoque et Atilio postponit.

laudat :

Cice'ro in Limone hactenus

Tu quoque, qui solus lecto sermone, Terenti,
Conversum expressumque Latina voce Menandrum

In medium nobis sedatis motibus effers,

Quiddam come loquens atque omnia dulcia dicens . . .

Item C. Caesar z

Tu quoque, tu in summis, o dimidiate Menander,
PoneriS, et merito, puri sermonis amator.
Lenibus atque utinam scriptis adiuncta foret vis

Te-

1. Terenti num, etc. .·
verse is an iambic senarius.
renti depends upon similem.

2. Naevio, etc. .· Aulus Gellius,
15. 24, quotes the passage in
full. In it the comic poets
are arranged in the order of
their merit as follows: Caeci-
lius, Plautus, Naevius, Licinius,
Atilius, Terence, Turpilius, Tra-.
bea, Luscius, Ennius.

3. Limone: i.e.,
“meadow.” It was a literary
criticism in verse, which has not
been preserved.

5. tu quoque, etc. .· these
verses and those quoted from
Caesar are hexameters.

7. in medium nobis effers:
properly, “ you bring out into

our midst ”3 translate “ you

Λειμών,

sedatis motibus: Latin plays

action.'' Terence seems to
have modified Menander in the
direction of the former type.
Translate “with less action.''

8. come: “genial.'’

10. in summis: “ in the first
rank.’'

12. atque is virtually equiva-
lent to atqui, as in Andria 225.

vis comica: the meaning
of the phrase is not clear. It
cannot refer to the boisterous
fun which was Plautus’ chief
stock in trade; for the com-
parison here is with Menander
who, like Terence, prefers humor
to horseplay. Perhaps Caesar
was thinking of the marvelous
