sative case of quoius in its
original use as a possessive
adjective like meus. The
original genitive of qui and quis
was quois (see on eius, 93), and
the classical use of quoius (later
cuius) is due to a contamina—
tion of the possessive adjective
and the original genitive. The
adjective use of quoius (cuius)
is frequent in early Latin and
appears occasionally in the later
colloquial language.

765. vostri is the genitive
of the possessive. Although
Terence probably had no
definite substantive in mind,
we need one in English;
translate “your master’s.''
-quoius is the genitive of
the interrogative. For the pro-
nunciation‚⁴ see on eius (93).
Translate quoius nostri freely
“ which one of our masters?''

766. eho, an: for the force

of the two words, see on 500.
—sempert but compare 100.
The inconsistency is a sound
bit of psychology.

767. animum advortendum:
for the construction, see on 156.

768. quemne = isne est puer
(μένω i.e., quem is a relative
referring to puerum, which is
understood (from 763) with
Pampili in line 765. Trans-
late “ the one whom . . . ?'’

769. O hominem: for the
hiatus, see Introduction 20.—
verum: the subject is Davos’
last remark. The omission of
the copula is common.

770. suffarcinatam: the verb

farcio and its derivative farcino

mean “stuff‚'' as one does a
pillow. The prefix sub here
means virtually “under her
clotheS.'' Translate “ carrying
something under her cloak.”
