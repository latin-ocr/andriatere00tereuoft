749. satin is the colloquial
form of satis-ne,· for the loss
of s, see on censen (256).
Satis here means “quite,'' as
it often does.

750. Davos seizes the oppor-
tunity to make Cremes believe
that his presence has not been
noticed.

751. Davos threatens Musis
in order to convince Cremes that
they are really enemies. Her
exclamation of fear is precisely
what he wants; but at the
same time she draws away from
him toward Cremes. Hence

time to cut off a dangerous
verb.

753. faxis is an early Latin
future, equivalent to sacies.¹
The tense is conjugated in the
same way as a present of the
third conjugation. Histori-
cally the formation is parallel
with the future in Greek
(δείξω, etc.), which is in
origin the subjunctive of an
aorist (ἔδειξα, etc.). Oscan
and Umbrian, two Italic dia-
lects closely related to Latin,
form their future in the same
way. From the same (aorist)
stem fax-‚ early Latin forms a
subjunctive (with present force)

the whispered command that fax-im, which is conjugated
follows. like sim, and was, like sim,
752. For a second time originally an optative. Both

Davos' interruption is just in

formations are far less common

¹ Plautus seems to use the form in the sense of the future perfect some-
what more often than he does the regular future ; but the future sense is

also common.
