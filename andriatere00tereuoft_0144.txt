641. fuero and gessero have
the same temporal force as
promoveris (640).—animo is
virtually equivalent to mihi.
Compare the common periphra-
sis with animus, as in Livy, 21.
22. 1, ad sollicitandos principum
animos, which differs only in
preposition and substantive
from Livy, 21. 2. 7, in solli-
citandis gentibus.

642. Pampilus hastens to
make his confession as soon as
he sees Carinus. - respiciunt:
sc. nos. ·

643. soluisti

The compound exsolvere is more

fidem: “ you

usual in this sense, but solvere
very frequently means “ pay‚”
and is used with fidem as object
in Ov., Fast. Ι. 642, and else-
where.

644. ducere: for the mean-
ing, see on duci (180). —
postulas: “expect.'’

645. conplacitast: this verb
is usually active, but here it is
deponent. The prefix is in-
tensive.

646. spectavi: “ judged.”
Carinus regrets that he should
have thought Pampilus as hon—
orable as himself.

648. lactasses, produceres:
for the pluperfect subjunctive
