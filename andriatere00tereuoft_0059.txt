INTRODUCTION 55

One kind of hiatuS, however, is much more common in
Terence and the other early dramatists than in Vergil and
his contemporaries. Accented monosyllables ending in a
long vowel or m are not elided before a short vowel, but
count as a single short syllable, as qui dmant (191), cit‘m ἕο
(639), etc. Sometimes the syllable following such a mono-
syllable is shortened by the iambic law, as tzz'm id mihi (109).

21. While the iambic ‚senarii (comprising about half of'
each of Terence’s plays) were spoken without musical accom-
paniment, all lines in other meters were accompanied by the
flute. Many of them were delivered by the actors in recita-
tive style, but some of the more lyrical passages were sung by
a slave stationed near the flute player while the actor per-
formed in pantomime.

22. The iambic octonarius (from octoni, “eight apiece'')
contains eight feet. The last of these must be ·an iambus or a
pyrrhic. There is usually a caesura before the ictus syllable
of the fifth foot, or (less frequently) a diaeresis at the end of
the fourth foot. In the latter case the fourth foot is often

. an iambuS, for which a pyrrhic may be substituted just as at

the clodse of the line. Line 175 of the Andria should be

23. The iambic septenarius (from septeni, “seven apiece’')
contains seven complete feet followed by a single syllable.
There is usually a diaeresis after the fourth foot, which is
commonly an iambus and occasionally a pyrrhic. Some-
