Teneo.

[Exeunt, Musis to the

right, Pampilus into Glucerium's house]

more compounds than the later
language.

295. virum: “husband.’' The
word is to be taken in a fig-
urative sense just as patrem is. —
tutorem: “ guardian.”

296. tfiae owes its short ul-
tima to the iambic law. *—
fidez' in early Latin the geni-

tive and the dative singular of ,

the fifth declension often had
monosyllabic endings —— prob-
ably diphthongal -ei in the geni-
tive and -ἓ in the dative.

297. hanc mi in manum dat:
“ put her hand in mine.'’ ¹

299. ab illa is shortened by
the. iambic law. — audin=
audisne,· for the loss of 5 and
e, see on censen (256). Such
forms as these are colloquial.
The question is equivalent to a
command; “do you hear?’'
= “ listen.''

300. cave: sc. dicas; trans-
late “not a word.''——ad morbum:
English word order requires a
verb if we are to translate the
prepositional phrase3 cf. non
tu ibi gnatum . . .-(149). —hoc
etiam: “this too.''—teneo: “I
understand.''

¹ Since all this happened in Athens, manus cannot mean “ possession,
control '' as it does in Roman law. Even if we assume that Terence has
here deserted his original and is thinking of Roman customs‚ Crusis could
not have given Pampilus manus over Glucerium.
