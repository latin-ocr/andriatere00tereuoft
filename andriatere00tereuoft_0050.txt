luserat ipse, nomine illius in scaenam detulit.'

Nepos auctore certo

comperisse se ait C. Laelium quondam in Puteolano kalendis Martiis
admonitum ab uxore, temperius ut discumberet, petisse ab ea ne
interpellaretur, seroque tandem ingressum triclinium dixisse non
saepe in scribendo magis sibi successisse3 deinde rogatum ut
scripta illa proferret, pronuntiasse versus qui sunt in Heautontimo-

rumeno ἱ

Satis pol proterve me Syri promissa huc induxerunt. ⁷

Santra Terentium existimat, si modo in scribendo adiutoribus
indiguerit, non tam Scipione et Laelio uti potuisse, qui tunc adules- 10
centuli fuerint, quam C. Sulpicio Gallo, homine docto et quo
consule Megalensibus ludis initium fabularum dandarum fecerit,

1. luserat: ludo is often used
(transitively) of composing the
lighter forms of poetry.

2. Puteolano: for the mean-
ing, see on Albanum (ἓ 2).

kalendis Martiis: on this
day the Matronalia were cele-
brated, and therefore partic-
ular respect would be paid to
the ladies of the family.

3. temperius: “ somewhat
earlier than usual.''

5. successisse is impersonal,
as is successit in Andria 670.

6. pronuntiasse versus, ete..·
if Nepos has his facts straight
(see on Nepos, §2), one may
conjecture that Laelius' quota-
tion from Terence was really
a jesting refusal to recite his
own composition. It is not
hard to see how Syri promissa
might be made to refer to the
entertainment which Laelius had

expected to find in the dining
room.

8. satis pol, etc..· line 723 of
Terence’s Heautontimorumenos.
It is an iambic septenarius (see
Introduction 23).

9. Santra was a scholar who
lived in Cicero's time. Very
little is known about him.

10. adulescentuli: when Ter-
ence produced his first play,
Laelius was twenty years old
and Scipio eighteen or nineteen.
The Adelphoe was produced
six years later.

11. C. Sulpicio Gallo: consul
in 166 B.c., the year in which the
Andria was first produced. He
was interested in Greek as-
tronomy and perhaps in Greek
literature.

12. Megalensibus ludis: the
ludi Megalenses, in honor of
Cybele, were celebrated in April
