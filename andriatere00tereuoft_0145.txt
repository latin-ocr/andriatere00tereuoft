representing a future perfect
and the imperfect representing
a future from a past point of
view, see on abiret (175).

649. habeas: the subjunc-
tive expressing a command
(see on quiescas, 598), like
the imperative, is often weak-
ened into an expression of per-
mission or indifference. — ha-
beam: for the mood, see on
essem (282).

651. carnufex: for the mean-
ing, see on 183.

652. dicas, cognoris: for
the tenses, see on sis, sentias
(310).

653. altercasti: the verb
is usually deponent. Contrast
conplacitast (645).

[Turns away] Pa.

655. Translate “Worse yet!
(and that's the reason you
don't understand my troubles.)’'
Immo introduces a correction,
as always. Etiam with immo is
usually additory or intensive,
and the phrase often gets from
the context the unfavorable im-
plication that it has here and in ²
lines 673 and 708 below. In
Plautus, Rud. 441, immo etiam
means “ better than that.'' The ·
antecedent of quo (an ablative of
cause or of degree of difference)
is the new information promised
by immo etiam and given in the
next line. Minus is a strong
negative, as in line 197.

656. haec = hae.

657. postulabat: as in 644.
