VACT I ScENE· 1

The division of Latin comedies
into acts is not indicated in the
manuscripts, but is important for
our understanding of the plays.
In the performance of the Greek
originals the chorus sang and
danced between the acts and
thus marked the play off into
clearly distinct parts. On the
Roman stage the flute player

sometimes furnished musical in- ,

terludes between the acts, but at
other times the performance
seems to have continued without
any pause. A necessary condi-
tion for the close of an act was
that none of the actors should
remain on the stage; but the
stage might be left vacant for a
moment in the middle of an act.

the stage, but the plan is not
carried out consistently.

enclitic -c(e)‚ ‘⁶ here, there,''
which always appears in certain
forms of hi-c, is often appended
to the forms of ille and iste. The
forms with appended -c(e) may
be found in the grammars : A. δι
G. 146 a, Bu. 244, G. 104. II 2,
1113, H. & B. 138. 2 e, H. 178. 6.
Istaec has here its exact force as
the demonstrative of the second
person, since it refers to the pro-
visions carried by the slaves. —
Sosia is Greek Σωσίας. (We find
the name.in Menander’s Pericei-
