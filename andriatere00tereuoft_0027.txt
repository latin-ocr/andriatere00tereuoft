NEW ATTIC COMEDY

4. The New Attic Comedy which grew up in the latter
half of the fourth century 13.c. was the heir of the tragedy of
Euripides no less than of the Old Comedy of Aristophanes.
It was like the Old Comedy in taking its characters from every-
day life instead of from myths and in a certain freedom from
hampering traditions. Like Old Comedy, too, is the avoid-
ance of the stronger forms of pity and fear, the emotions which
Aristotle regards as characteristic of tragedy. Closely allied
with this feature is the avoidance of unhappy endings. From
tragedy of the Euripidean type the New Comedy got its

such as the mutual recognition of long separated relatives.
Perhaps the most important of Euripides' contributions was
the tendency toward realism which made it possible for
Aristophanes of Byzantium to say of the greatest author of
the New Comedy: “Menander and Life, which of you
imitated the other ?''

These two lines of influence varied in their proportion-
ate strength from author to author and from *play to play.
In some pieces the rollicking, boisterous spirit of the Old
Comedy survived‚ while others were as romantic and subtle
as any of Euripides’ tragedies. There were many innova-
tions, too, which cannot be traced directly to the influence of
anything in the drama of the fifth century. Perhaps the
most important of these concerned the chorus, which in the
New Comedy had no essential connection with the play, but
merely furnished a musical interlude between the acts.

5. We may illustrate some of these characteristics by a
play of Menander, the author of the original of Terence's
Andria. None of his pieces has been preserved entire, and
until recently we have had only such fragments of them as
· are contained in quotations by later writers. Toward the
