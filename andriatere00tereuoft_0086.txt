Negare factum.

Ne haec quidem

Cedo.
Si.

147. negare is a historical
infinitive. —factum stands in
indirect discourse.

148. ut . . . neget: a result
clause, “under such circum-
stances that.'’ —- qui: ablative of
the indefinite pronoun, “ in some
way, in any way”; see on
qui (53). Here, as in atqui, its
force is much attenuated, and
scarcely translatable.

149. non tu ibi gnatum:
“Then didn't you . . . ?”
English word order prevents
us from translating gnatum un-
less we supply the verb.

150. qui: “why?''
qui (53).—cedo: ce is the
particle that
forms the second element of
lii-c, liis-ce, etc. (cf. on istaec,
28); d& is the original form
of the imperative of do (cf.
Gk. δι’«δω-θι). Cedo is regularly
shortened by the iambic law.

The word properly means “ give
here,” and it often has that
sense, sometimes with an object
expressed. Frequently, how-
ever, it refers, as here, to
an idea or a story, “ tell
me.” ¹

151 ff. Direct quotations
without a verb of saying are
rather common in Roman com—
edy. Such passages were made
clear on the‘stage by an altera-

tion of tone, a style of delivery ’-

which the Romans called by
a Greek word (μίμησις) mean-
ing “ imitation.” The ancient
commentator on , Terence says
of such delivery, aliena verba
sic pronuntiamus ut vana vide-
antur, “we repeat another's
words in such a tone as to make
them sound silly.'’ ,

151. his rebus: i.e.,
affairs. —praescripsti, for -scrip-
