TERENTr ANDRIA

Favete, adeste aequo animo et rem cognoscite,
Ut pernoscatis, ecquid spei sit relicuom,
Posthac quas faciet de integro comoediaS,
Spectandae an exigendae sirit vobis prius. ⁷

24. favete: sc. linguis‚· this
was a formula spoken before
the celebration of a sacrifice.
“ Favor <⁸the occasion > with
your tongues ” properly meant
“ use only words of good
omen '’; but, as no word was
quite certain to be free from ill
omen, the only safe procedure
was to be quiet. Hence the
phrase came to mean, as it does
here, “be quiet.’'—adeste:
“ be attentive.'’ — aequo:
“ fair.” —rem cognoscite in-
volves a metaphor from the
courts; “examine the case”
between Terence and his critics
by listening to this play.

25. spei is a monosyllable3

see on fide (296).—relicuom
(= reliquom, relicum) contains
four syllables in early Latin.

. 261. These verses· contain
an indirect question depending
upon pernoscatis (25), but at the
same time they give the sub-
stance of the hope (spei) men-.
tioned in the latter halfof line 2 5.

26. de integro: in contrast
to the old play which is about
to be presented; cf. introduc-
tory note on the prologue. -
comoedias: for the case, see on
fabulas (3).

27. spectandae, with which
we must understand sint from
exigendae sint, is the first half
of a double indirect question.
