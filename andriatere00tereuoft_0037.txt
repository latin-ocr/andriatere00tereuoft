INTROD UCTION 3 3

driving Stapula‚l his old slave woman, out of the house.
“Clear-out‚ Ι say, come, clear out; you’ve got to go out of
doors, you pop-eyed spy.” After twenty lines of threats he
takes us into his confidence. “I'm sure I never saw a worse
crook than this old woman, and I'm desperately afraid she'll
play me a trick or find out where the gold is hid; for the
wretch has extra eyes in the back of her head. Now I'll
go and see whether the gold is where I put it.''

Presently he returns.

Eucl. [To himself] I didn’t sweep away my worries and
come out till Ι saw that everything in the house was safe.
[To Stapula.] Now go in and stay on guard.

Stapula. Really? On guard in there? So that no one
shall steal the house ? For we haven't anything else that’s
worth a thief’s trouble3 the place is full of emptiness and
cobwebs,

Eucl. It’s a wonder Jupiter wouldn't make me a king
Philip or Darius just for your sake, you witch l I want those
cobwebs guarded. Lock the door with two bolts. I'll be
back presently. [Exit Stapula.] It’s torture to me to leave
my house; but I understand how Ι have to behave. The
chief of our curia promised to distribute a nummus to each of
us; if I fail to go after it, I suppose everybody will immedi-
ately suspect that I have a pot of gold at home, for it doesn't
ο look reasonable for a poor man to despise a little cash and so

’ not go to get his nummus. They’re suspicious already. I'm

going where I started to, and then I'll come back home as
soon as Ι can.

On his return he is met by his rich neighbor Megadorus,

Meg. Good morning, Euclio; I hope luck is coming your
way.
