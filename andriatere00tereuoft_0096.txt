TERENTI ANDRIA

Si senserit, perii3 afit si lubitum fuerit, causam ceperit,
Quo iure quaque iniuria praecipitem in pistrinum dabit.
Ad haec mala hoc mi accedit etiam : haec Andria,

Si ista uxor sive amicast, gravida e Pampilost.
Audireque eorumst operae pretium audaciam3

Nam inceptiost amentium, haud amantium.

Quidquid peperisset, decreverunt tollere.

Et fIngunt quandam inter se nunc fallaciam,

is the same dative that follows
male facere, etc.

213. perii: a very common
bit of slang, “ I'm done for.'' —
ceperit: in early Latin the
future perfect often has its
original force of a slightly
emphatic future; see Bennett,
Syntax of Early Latin 1. 54 ff.
Compare the use of the pluper—
fect as a simple past tense,
which we have noticed in
provideram (183).

214. quo iure quaque iniuria:
the antecedent of quo and qua is
causam, “according to which
justice and <it may be> injus-
tice'’; translate “ and so,
justly or unjustly.’'

217. eorum:
ening of the penult by the iam-
bic law, see Introduction 19
end. —operae pretium: “ worth
while.'' .

219. quidquid: for the neu-
ter referring to a person, see
on nil (120). — peperisset: sub-

for the short-A

junctive in a subordinate
clause in informal indirect dis-
course. — tollere: it lay within
the father’s discretiori to have
a new-born babe exposed, as
Pataecus did in Menander's
Periceiromene (Introduction 5),
and in the present case Davos
thinks that any sane father
would make away with the
child. If on the other hand
the father decided to rear the
infant he lifted it in his arms,
and so the verb tollo came
to mean “ acknowledge'' or
“ rear.”

220 ff. As the sequel shows,
Glucerium and Pampilus know
that the story is actually true,
although they are not in a posi-
tion to prove it. Davos, how-
ever, is in the habit of getting
out of difficulties per fallaciam,
and he suspects them of at-
tempting the same thing.

220. inter se: for the aecem,
see on apud me (36).
