14. The biography by Suetonius follows:

C. SUETONI TRANQUILLI
VITA TERENTI

1. P. Terentius Afer Carthagine natus servivit Romae Terentio
Lucano senatori, a quo ob ingenium et formam non institutus

modo liberaliter, sed et mature manu missus est.

tum esse existimant.

Quidam cap-

Quod fieri nullo modo potuisse Fenestella

docet, cum inter finem secundi Punici belli et initium tertii et
natus sit et mortuus; nec, si a Numidis vel Gaetulis captus sit,
ad ducem Romanum pervenire potuisse, nullo commercio inter
Italicos et Afros nisi post deletam Carthaginem coept0.

1. P. Terentius Afer: while
Terence was a slave, he seems
to have been called Afer, “ the
African‚” in allusion to his
nationality. When he was set
free, he took, according to the
usual practice, the praenomen
and the nomen of his former
master and kept his slave name
as a cognomen. The name Afer
proves that Terence was not
really a Carthaginian‚ although
he was born in Carthage; for
in that case he would have
been called Poenus or Poenulus.
Neither was he a negro, as some
Afro-Americans have main-
tained3 the word Afer applies
properly to a member of one of
the native North African tribes,
most of which were subject to
the Carthaginians. Very likely
he was born a slave, and carne

into the possession of his Roman
master by purchase or gift.

Carthagine: locative.

2. institutus: “ educated.''

3. manu missus est: consult
the dictionary under manumitto.

captum esse: i.e., in war.

4. Fenestella wrote, during
the reign of Tiberius, a work
called Annales. It has been lost,
but the rather numerous quota-
tions from it by later authors indi-
cate that Fenestella paid especial
attention to antiquarian curi-
osities and literary history.
The deductions quoted from him
here and in the next section dis-
play the best type of scholarship.

8. deletam: the participle car-
ries the most important idea of
the phrase, as in the title of
Livy’s history, Ab Urbe Condita.

coepto goes with commercio.
