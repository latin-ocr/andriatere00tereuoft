34 INTRODUCTION

Eucl. Thank you, Megadorus.

Meg. You’re looking very well indeed.

Eucl. [Aside] It’s not for nothing when a rich man speaks
so pleasantly to a poor man. The fellow knows already
that I’ve got gold; that's the reason for his kind “Good
morning.”

Meg. You are well, aren't you ?

Eucl. Not very, in money matters.

Meg. If you look at the matter fairly, you have enough to
live comfortably on.

Eucl. [Aside.] The old woman has certainly told him
about the gold: it's as plain as day. 'I'm going ri'ght in
and cut off her tongue and dig out her eyes.

Meg. What are you saying to yourself?

Eucl. Complaining of my poverty. I have a grown-up
daughter who has no dowry, I can't marry her to any one.

Meg. Hush ! Take beart, Euclio. You'll marry her off;
I’ll help you out; command me if you need anything.

Eucl. [Asida] His promising amounts to begging. He

has his mouth wide open for the gold. In one hand he has.

a stone while with the other he offers bread. I've no con-
fidence in a rich man who talks pleasantly to a poor man.
I know your octopuses that hold on to whatever they once
touch. “

Meg. Listen a moment, if you are at leisure, Euclio, to a

request that Ι want to make of you for our common advan- ¹

tage.

Eucl. [Aside.] Dear me ! He’s got his hook in my gold !
That’s what he wants to come to terms with me about, I'm
sure. But I'm going in and have a look. [Starts sor his
house]

, Meg. Where are you going ?

Eucl. I'll be back right away3 there's something Ι must

look after in the house.
