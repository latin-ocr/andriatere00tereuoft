them presented ‘at certain pub-
lic festivals.

ante = antea; i.e.‚ before
they would decide whether or
not to purchase the play.

Caecilio: Caecilius Statius
was the leading comic poet of
the generation between Plautus
and Terence. His plays have
been lost except for a few lines
that are quoted by later authors.
He died 168 B.c. For some
unknown reason the Andria
was not produced for sixteen
months or more after this
interview.

ad: “ to the house of”; cf.
on ad (ξ 2). With cenantem
sc. eum = Caecilium.

1. fabulae: “play.''

3. percucurrisse:
through‚'’ i.e.‚ “read.”

4. Caecilii: subjective geni-
tive.

5. Volcatius: Volcatius Sedi-
gitus‚ a scholar of uncertain date,
wrote a work called De Poetis.
The passages cited from it are
in iambic senarii (see Introduc-
tion 17). ¹

dinumeratione: as Volcatius
is known to have drawn up a
list of the comic poets ar-
ranged in the order of their
merit (see on Naevio, etc„ ξ 7),
it is not surprising that this.
list of Terence's plays was so
arranged.

7. sumetur sexta: “ shall be
chosen for sixth place.’' The
reason for putting the Hecyra
last is given at the end of the
verse.

8. Eunuchus: another of
Terence's plays. The title of a
play (sabula) is regularly treated
as feminine.

9. nummorum = sestertium.
