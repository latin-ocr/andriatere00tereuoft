Quod illi maledictum vehemens esse existimant,
Eam laudem hic ducit maximam, quom illis placet,
Qui vobis universis et populo placent,

Quorum opera in bello, in oti0‚ in negotio

Suo quisque ternpore usust sine superbia.

Videtur autem levius se defendisse, quia sciebat et Laelio et Scipioni
non ingratam esse hanc opinionem; quae tum magis et usque ad

posteriora tempora valuit.

C. Memmius in oratione pro se ait,

‘P. Africanus, qui a Terentio personam mutuatus, quae domi

himself in the third person in
his prologues.

1. quod: the antecedent is
eam in the next line. Each pro-
noun agrees in ‘gender and
number with its predicate noun.

illi: i.e.‚ isti malevoli.

2. quom illis pla'cet is a
clause of fact, with quom, “ that,''
where classical Latin would
use quod‚· see H. & B. 5533 cf.
'L. ἃ Μ. 860. Most scholars
regard quom as causal in this
use.

4. opera:
with usust.

5. suo tempore: “at his con-
venience”; i.e.‚ whenever it
has seemed best.

usust = usus est. For the
form, see on dictust (Andria 102).

sine superbia: “ without dis-
dain''; i.e.‚ “since you have
not been above using their
assistance, why should I be? '' 1

ablative singular

6. Laelio et Scipioni: as we
have just shown, these were
not the names that Terence had
in mind.

8. C. Memmius: a shifty
politician of Cicero's day.
When he was governor of
Bithynia, the poet Catullus was
a member of his staff. Although
Memmius certainly had little
sympathy with Epicurean phi-
losophy and was interested in
Greek rather than Latin litera-
ture, Lucretius'dedicated to him

his philosophical poem, De
Rerum Natura.
9. personam: “mask.” Al-

though masks were not worn by
Roman actors in Terence’s time,
they were usual in Memmius’
day, and had always been worn
by Greek actors. Here “ bor-
rowed a mask” is a figura-
tive way of saying “wrote
plays under another’s name.''
