Sic cogitabam: ‘hic parvae consuetudinis

Causa huius mortem tam fert familiariter:

Quid si ipse amasset ? Quid hic mihi faciet patri ?’
Haec ego putabam esse omnia humani ingeni

Mansuetique animi officia,

Quid multis moror?

Egomet quoque eius causa in funus prodeO,

Nil suspicans etiam mali.

Scies.

So. Hem, quid est? Si.

Quae ibi aderant, forte unam aspicio adulescemulam‚

Forma . . . So,

Sosia,

Bona fortasse.

. et voltu,

'Adeo modestQ adeo venust0‚ ut nil supra.

112. mihi: the original pros-
ody; see Introduction 19.

115. funus: Athenian law
required that the corpse should
be burned before daylight on
the morning following the death.

116. etiam is temporal‚
“,still.'’

117. imus: i.e.‚ in the
funeral procession. —mfilieres :
for the accent, see on be'nefici
(44)-

118. The fourth foot is a
proceleusmatic.

119 ff. Similarly Homer, ll.
3. 154 ff.‚ puts the praise of his
heroine’s beauty in the mouths
of old men who had good reason
for a prejudice against her.

119. voltu = vultu ,·

parvolo (35).
120. adeo was originally a

see on

phrase in which ad was followed

by eo, the adverb of direction
(cf. adhuc). The first mean-

ing, then, was “ to this place '’ . -

or “ to such a place,'' but the
local idea is rarely retained.
Here the meaning is “ to such
a degree, so.’'—ut nil supra:
sc. esse posset. — nil: the neuter
often refers in a general way to
persons; thus Cicero, Ad Quint.
F rat. 3. 1. 19, says of his young
nephew: Nihil puero illo sua-
vius, nihil nostri amantius. A
common phrase for “ my sweet-
heart '⁹ is quod amo.¹

¹Green, CR. 18. 448 ff„ thinks that the neuter in such cases necessarily
involves emphasis. lt certainly does not in the second instance cited above
and similar ones; and consequently there is room for doubt as to the others.
