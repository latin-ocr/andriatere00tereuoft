ACTUS 1, SCENA 1

Prope adest, quom alieno more vivendfimst mihi:
Sine nfinc meo me vivere interea modo.'

,ι So, Qui igitur relictus est obiurgandi locus ?

ι 155 Si. Si propter amorem uxorem nolit ducere,

Ea primum ab illo animum advortenda iniuriast.

Et nunc id operam do, fit per falsas nuptias

Vera obiurgandi causa sit, si denegem

Simul sceleratus Davos, si quid consili

Habet, ut consumat nune, quom nil obsint doli.

which gives dictust from dictu-
[s e]st (see note on 102). Simi-
lar forms are promisti from
promi[si]sti, intellexti from in-
tellexisti (= intellec[si]sti), dixti
from dixisti (= dic[si]sti).
Perfects shortened in this
way are very rare in formal
prose of the classical period.

152. prope adest quom:
English idiom requires that we
insert a phrase such as “the
time, the day,” to serve as ante-
cedent of “ when '⁹ and as subject
of the main verb. — vivendumst
= vivendum est‚· see on ex-
probratiost (44).

156. primum: “ for the first
time '⁹3 so again line 936.—
animum advortenda iniuriast:
the phrase animum advorto
(Classical -verto) is treated as if
it were a verb, i.e., in the active
it takes a direct object, and
this becomes the subject of the

⁸· passive (see G. 342, H. &·B,

391. 3). The phrase is often
written as one word, animad-
verto.

157 ff. Simo hopes that if he
can take his son to task When
he has the right clearly on his
side, he can get the boy away
from Glucerium. Then there
will be no obstacle in the way
of the match with Cremes'
daughter.

157. id: operam do, like ani-
mum advorto, is a phrase which
governs a direct object3 it is
equivalent to curo,

159. sceleratus: “ rascal.''
In the comedies the young
man's body-slave is usually
ready to help him evade his
father's wishes. ——Davos = Da-
vus‚· see on parvolo (35).

160. ut: in classical prose
the conjunction would normally
stand before sceleratus, at the
head of the clause, and that is
the most common arrangement
