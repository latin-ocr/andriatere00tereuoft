TERENTI ANDRIA

Sed postquam amans accessit pretium pollicens
Unus et item alter, ita ut ingeniumst omnium
Hominum ab labore proclive ad lubidinem,
Accepit condicionem, dehinc quaestum occipit.
Qui tum illam amabant, forte, ita fit fit, filium
Perduxere illuc, secum ut sina esset, meum.

Egomet continuo mecum ε

Habet.'

Venientis afit abeuntis.

loquial than in formal Latin.
Often they are weakened until
they scarcely differ in meaning
from the primitive verb.

78. proclive: “ downhill ”3
be careful to keep the metaphor
in your translation.

79. condicionem: “terms.”
-dehincz pronounced deinc
with diphthongal ei, as regu-
larly in all periods of the lan-
guage3 so deinde, dein, proinde,
proin contain diphthongs. The
spelling with h was retained be·-
cause every one was conscious
that the compound contained
hinc. — quaestum: translate
“ profession‚'' although quae-
stus in its original sense is
nearer English “ trade '’ or “ oc-
cupation.” —- occipit: an early
Latin synonym of incipit.

82. egomet: ’ the use of the
strengthened form of the pro-
noun without marked emphasis

‘certe captus est;
Observabam mane illorum servolos
Rogitabam ‘heus puer,

Dic sodeS, quisheri Crusidem habuit ?' nam Andriae

is characteristic of colloquial
Latin. The omission of the
verb of saying is another collo-
quialism.

83. habet, in the slang of the

arena, meant “ he has his
deathblow.'’ -— servolos: for the
diminutive, see on adules-

centuli (55); for, the spelling,
see on' parvolo (35).

84. rogitabam: see on quaeri-
tans (75). Here the frequenta-
tive has its full force. —- puer:
colloquial for serve, just as in the
Southern States “ boy '' formerly
meant “slave'' (of any age).

85. sodes stands for si audes,-
the vowel of si was.elided and
au tended to become ὅ in collo-
quial Latin. The¹ verb audeo
is a derivative of avidus, and
in this phrase it retains its
original meaning “ desire '’;
translate “ if you please.'' —
Crusidem: the classical form
