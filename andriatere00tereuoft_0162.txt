TERENTI ·’ ANDRIA

Litis sequi, quam hic mihi sit facile atque utile,

Aliorum exempla commonent.-

Simul arbitror,

Iam aliquem esse amicum et defensorem ei; nam fere
Grandicula iam profectast illinc3 clamitent
Me ssicopz'intam, hereditatem persequi
Mendicum. Tum ipsam despoliare non lubet.
Da. O optume hospes! Mu. P6l, Crito, antiquom obtines.
Cr. Duc me ad eam, quando huc veni, ut videam. Mu. .

Maxume.

[Exeunt into Glucqrium's house]

Da. Sequar h6s3 „me nolo in tempore hoc videat senex.

eigner.” Crito’s legal claim to
the estate was still valid, since
Glucerium was not really Crusis'
sister, It would, however, be
necessary to prove that fact in
a court of law, and a foreigner
had a poor chance of convincing
an Athenian jury.

811. litis sequi, “ go to law‚”
is a literal translation of Greek
δίκην διώκειν. - hic is the adverb.

814. grandicula: the collo-
quial diminutive may be ren-
dered “ in her teens.'’ —- illinc:
i.e., from Andros.

815. sucopantam: the classi-
cal form would be sycophantes
(Gk. συκοφάντης), but our dic-
tionaries give sycophanta.

816. The ease with which

[Exit into Glucerium's heusen]

one can make a virtue of neces-
sity is a chief reason for the
good reputation which such
people as Crito usually enjoy.
Musis is genuinely impressed
by his generosity. Davos, how-
ever, is hardly the man to at-
tribute better motives than the
facts warrant. His commenda-
tion is a bit of ironical flattery.

817. Ο optume: for the hia-
tus, see Introduction 20. —anti-
quom: “the good old way '';
virtue of every sort is char-
acteristic of the “ good old
days‚'' which always lie some
fifty or seventy-five years in
the past.

818. maxume:
means.”
