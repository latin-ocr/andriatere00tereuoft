and have often spoken with her — first go and talk to her;
take her my message, Ι beg you.

Pat Now that’ s just what I think ought to be done.
[Starts away. ]

Pol. But of course you are a good speaker, Pataecus ?

Pat. F airly.

Pol. But really, Pataecus, you must be. That's the way
to save the day. For if I've ever been wholly in the wrong —-
If I don't alwa'ys do my best — Now if you'd only look at the
clothes she has —

Pat. Oh ! That’s all right.

Pol. Do look at them, Pataecus3 you'll be sorrier for me.

Pat. [Asida] Ye gods!

Pol. Come on ! What clothes ! How fine she looked
when she wore them! For I suppose you've never seen.

Pat. Yes, I have.

Pol. And then she was so magnificently tall; but why do
I speak of that. Ρ - fool that I arn to talk of things that don’ t
matter.

. Pat. Oh l Not at all !

Pol. You think not? Well‚ at any rate you must see
the‘ clothes, Come in.

Pat. Very well, I'll come. [Exeunt into Polemon's house]

The next we see of Pataecus he is in the midst of his con-
versation with Glycera. She begs him to inspeet the tokens
of her parentage which her foster mother gave her. After a
short lacuna in the text we find them examining some figures
embroidered on the clothing in which the babies were exposed.
Pataecus has made out one figure. “Isn't this a goat stand-
ing next, or an οΧ, or some such beast ?''

Gly. It's a stag, dear friend, not a goat !
Pat. At least it has hornS‚ I know that much.
Gly. And this third ?
