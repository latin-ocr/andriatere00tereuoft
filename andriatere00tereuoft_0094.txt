TERENTI ANDRIA

Ita aperte ipsam rem modo locsltu'S, nil circum itione

fisus es.

Si.

Da. Bona verba, quaeso. Si. Inrides; nil me fallis.

dico tibi :

Ubivis facilius passus sim quam in hac re me delfidier.

Sed

Ne temere facias, neque tu haud dicas tibi non praedic-

tum. Cave.

synonymous words, “ Do you
still not yet understand not
even this?''—-immo means
“ quite the contrary,'' and either
reverses or strengthens the pre-
ceding statement3 but in order
to keep the colloquial tone it
is better to weaken it here to
a mere “ yes.” The traditional
translation, “nay,'' is a word
no longer heard in familiar
speech, and should never be
used in translating Plautus and
Terence.

202. ita: for the meaning,
see on 173. — locutu's = lo-
cutus es,· see on dictust (102).

· — circum: for the adverb modi-

fying a verbal noun, cf. on
immemori (44).

20ss facilius here has the
classical accent, instead of scici-
lius which is usual in early

-ari‚ -eri, -ἰ, and -iri, early
Latin has a second series of
forms with -er appended to
these endings. The infinitive
in -er was going out of use in
Terence’s day.

204. bona verba, quaeso:
even to mention a calamity
was an evil omen; we find
countless euphemistic substi-
tutes for morior. Here Davos

pretends to be shocked by Simo’s , -Ᾰ

me deludier, and exclaims‚
“ Don't speak of such a thing.''
Bona verba means, in the lan-
guage of ritual, “ words of good
omen.'' — inrides3 nil me fallis:
“ you're making fun of me; I’m
not blind to that.''

205. ne facias: the second
person singular of the present
subjunctive is used freely in
early Latin to express a pro-
hibition. Not infrequently it
is introduced by neque or nec,
as dicas is in this line. — neque
haud: haud and non, unlike
