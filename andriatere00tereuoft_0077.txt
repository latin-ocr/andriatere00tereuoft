Eorum 6bsequi studiis, advorsus nemini,

Sine invidia lafidem invenias et amicos pareS.
So. Sapienter vitam instituit3 namque hoc tempore
Obsequium amic08‚ veritas odium parit.

Agebat, lana ac tela victum quaeritans3

72. aetate integra: “with her
life all before her, in the prime
of life‚'' or, somewhat less ex-
actly‚ “in the bloom of youth.''

73. ei: the interjection.
