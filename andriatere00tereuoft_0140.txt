Pa. Nempe (it modo. Da. smmo melius spero. Pa. Oh,
tibi ego ut credam, furcifer ?
Tu rem inpeditam et perditam restituas? Em quo

fretus sim,

Qui me hodie ex tranquillissuma re coniecisti in nsip-

tias ἕ

An non dixi esse hoc futurum? Da. Dixti.
Da. Crucem.

Quid meritfi's ?

Pa.

Sed sine paululum ad me redeam3 iam aliquid dis-
piciam. Pa. Ei mihi,

to the consciousness of the
Romans, even in passages where
we have to use a more abstract
expression. Here we have the
full original force of the verbs;
“ I've got my foot in a snare?
“ I'll get you loose.’' The
vaguer secondary use is illus-
trated by rem inpeditam (619).

618, ut credam: for the
mood, see on ut advorser (263).
—furcifer: “scoundrel‚’' liter-
ally “fork—bearer.” Slaves
were often punished by being
compelled to wear a fork-shaped
wooden yoke‚ the prongs of
which were bound to their

hands.

619. restituas is in the same
construction as credam (618).—
em quo fretus sim: em is
here equivalent to vide, as often

(see on 351), and is followed
by an indirect question.l For
the short final syllable of fretus,
see on veritus sum (582).

620. The words ex tran-
quillisuma re coniecisti in in-
volve a metaphor from the sea,
and the hearer will expect some
such word as scopulos. Pam-
pilus, however, substitutes what
seems to him the most effective,
because most terrible, climax
of all. Compare the different
suggestion of the verb conicere
in line 602 (see the note on that
passage).

621. meritu's =7meritus es,-
for the form, see on dictust
(102). For the translation, see
on commerui (139).

622. ad me: for the mean-
ing, compare apud te (408).

would scarcely be possible here,
