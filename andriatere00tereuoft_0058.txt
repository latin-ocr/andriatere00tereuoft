but most words seem to have varied freely between the two
pronunciations.l

The early dramatists reflect this situation in their verse.
Almost any iambic succession of syllables with an accent next
to the long syllable may be treated as two short syllables,
but the frequency with which the shortened form of each
word occurs reflects roughly the usage of ordinary speech.²

In Plautus and Terence there occur a number of shortened
iambi which do not seem to have a word or sentence accent on
the syllable preceding or following the shortened syllable,
and in some of these the shortened syllable itself seems to be
accented. It is possible that in some cases our information
as to early Latin accent is defective, but most such irregulari-
ties are probably due to the influence of related words which
fulfilled the conditions of the change; tibique is due, then,‘
to tibi, nescib‘ (340, etc.) to 1⁶55, advenis (909) to vivas, e5dem
(885) to 235, eb‘rum (64, etc.) tp Z5ru'mque and Z5ru'ndem,
fuisse (42) to such forms as fai, sdisse'mus, and filistique,
k6ccinb‘st (236, etc.) to hic zu, etc. ’

Many scholars think that the verse ictus had the same
tendency as the accent of ordinary speech to shorten the long
syllable-of an iambus, It is at least true that a syllable ’
shortened by the iambic law rarely stands under the
ictuS.³ '

20. In general, Terence makes the same use of elision as
the later poets. Hiatus occurs after interjections, e.g., ὂ
hb‘mi'nem (769); and occasionally at a change of speakerS,
as in line 593.

¹ Some scholars would prefer to say “were pronounced with a quantity
intermediate between long and short.”
