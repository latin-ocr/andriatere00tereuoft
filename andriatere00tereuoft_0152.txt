148 TERENTI ANDRIA

Amicum, amatorem, virum in quovis loco
Paratum3 verum ex eo nunc misera quern capit
Laborem ! Facile hic plus malist quarn illic boni. 5
[Enter Davos with the baby in his arms]
Sed Davos exit. Mi homo, quid istuc obsecrost ?
Quo portas puerum ? Da. Musis, nunc opus est tua
Mihi ad hanc rem exprompta malitia atque astutia.
Mu. Quid narn incepturu's ? Da. [Offering her the huby]
⁵ Accipe a me hunc ocius
Atque ante nostram ianuam appone. Mu. Obsecro, 10
Humine ? Da. Ex ara hinc ssime verbenas tibi
Atque eas substerne. Mu. Quam ob rem id,t1'1te non

facis ?

Da. Quia, si forte opus sit, ad erum ifirandfimst mihi

718. loco: “occasion.''

720. laborem: the word often
means “trouble.’'—— hic . . .
illic ε “ on this side of the account

. on that ”3 hic refers to
line 719, illic to lines 717 f.

721. Express the exact force
of istuc in your translation.

723. malitia: “trickery.''
—astutia: “ cunning.” Davos
is ironical‚ for Musis possesses
neither quality.

724. ocius: “ at once.'’

725. appone: here and in
729 the manuscripts favor the
assimilated form, but in 763
they indicate adposisti. Of

course so inconsistent an orthog- ⁷

raphy does not represent the

facts of the language. In actual
speech the Romans seem al-

ways to have assimilated final ,

consonants of verbal prefixes
when that was possible.

726. ara: the altarof Apollo,
god of ways and streets‚ which
stood before the house. —ver-
benas: leafy boughs, with which
the altar was decked. —tibi:
dative of reference with sume,
“ help yourself to.’'

728 f. quia . . . iurandumst
—ut . . . possim: each clause
is an answer to Musis' question.
One may answer the question
“ why ?'' equally well by a causal
clause or by a purpose clause, and
here Davos combines the two.

efficient attitude of mere wishing accords better with the usual character of

lovers in the comedies.
