PROLOGUS ·

Poeta quom primum animum ad scribendum adpulit,
Id sibi negoti credidit solum dari, ¹

Populo fit placerent quas fecisset fabulaS.

Verum aliterqe'tvenire multo intellegit ;

Nam in prologis scribundis operam abutitur,

’ The Andria was first pre-
sented without a prologue; for
Terence felt that literary criti-
cism did not combine well
with comedies of life and man-
ners (see Introduction 13). It
· is of course fortunate for us
that he was compelled to vio-
late his artistic principles and
record for all time the informa-
tion that is contained in the
extant prologues. The fact re-
mains, however, that no one of
them forms an artistic unity
with the play to which it is pre-
fixed. Nevertheless‚ in defer·-
ence to custom, the prologue
which was written for a revival
os the Andria is included in this
edition. In the notes on the
play itself no acquaintance with
the prologue or the commen-
tary on it is assumed.

1. poeta: Terence speaks of
himself in the third person in the
prologues‚ as an English writer

often refers to himself as “the
author.'’ — quom = cum. For
the spelling, see on quomque (63).

2. id negoti = id negotium.
Negoti is a partitive genitive.

3. fabulas is logically the ·
subject of placerent and the
antecedent of quas, but it is
incorporated into the relative
clause3 “what plays '⁹ instead
of “ the plays which.''

4. multo: ablative of degree
of difference with aliter.

5. prologis has a long vowel
in the first syllable, although in
Greek πρόλογος the first vowel
is short. Latin pr& has influ-
enced this and several other
Greek loan words contain-
ing the preposition πρό.-
scribundis = scribendis ‚· for the
form, see on pariundi (233).
— operam : abutor always takes
the accusative in Plautus and
Terence, although utor usually
governs the ablative. In early
