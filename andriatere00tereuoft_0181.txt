258. The Mss. have nunc after quis. This emendation of
Dziatzko'S‚ accepted by Klotz, Altr5mische Metrik 211, is re-
jected by Fairclough because he considers iambic e‘g6 impossible.
That form, however, occurs in 702, 864, and 967. In line '850 the
text is uncertain. For parallels in PlautuS, see Klotz, Altrb'mische
Metrik 52, and Lindsay, The Captivi of Plautus page 17.

277. Bentley read ut vim so as to get an accent on vim. The same
end may be attained by scanning vim ut.

300. Some students think that Pampilus remains on the stage,
and those who have felt that the stage should be vacant have made
him accompany Musis or enter his father’s house. We must sup-
pose, however, that he is anxious to see and reassure Glucerium
after what Musis has told him; and no conflicting motive has been
provided by the poet. Compare below on line 624.

337. Most editors adopt Bentley’s emendation. He says:
Certe alterutrum legendum est, aut opus est scire aut opus sunt
sciri. Posterius placet. Ι do not know of another example of an
infinitive after opus sunt ,· but there seems to be no reason for pre-
ferring a passive infinitive to an active.

372. With Klotz I retain ne'cesse, the reading of the Mss. and
Donatus. Most editors print necessus, because Lachmann, on
Lucr. 6. 815, argued on the basis of two passages (Heaut. 360, and
Eun. 998) that Terence always used that form before a consonant.

378. So Spengel, Fleckeisen, Tyrrell. I am unable to under-
stand Fairclough’s objection to altering habeat of the Mss.; it
represents a particularly easy corruption in view of the difference
between early and later Latin syntax.

412. That Burria enters from the right, not from a house repre· ’
sented in the scene, appears from line 414, hunc venientem sequor.
There seems to be no good reason for thinking that Carinus’ house is
represented in the scene.

447. It seems necessary to adopt with Fleckeisen Bentley’s
conjecture of the Plautine form aliquantillum in order to account for
aliquantulum, the metrically impossible reading of D and E. Most
editors read aliquantum with the other Mss.

449. Davos’ puerilest furnishes a satisfactory antecedent for

id (otherwise Schlee, ALL. 3. 556).
