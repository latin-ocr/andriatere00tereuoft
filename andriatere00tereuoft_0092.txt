186. hoccine: hocce before
-ne becomes hocci- by the
same process which gives us
colligo beside lego, reddidi be-
side dedi, legite beside lege,
undique beside unde, etc. Hocce
is from *hod (the old neuter of
the stem ho-‚ with the same
case ending as quod) ψεῖ.-
agis: ago in the sense of “ at-
tend to, pay attention to ” is
very common in colloquial
Latin, especially with a neuter
pronoun as object. The use
of the present indicative for the
future (“ will you attend?'')
is another feature of colloquial
Latin. Some scholars, however,
understand agis as a true pres-
ene—istuc answers to Simo's
hoccine. .

187. antehac: this is in ori-

gin a phrase3 for ante was once
used with the ablative. The
final e of ante was therefore
lost by elision‚ and the whole
was pronounced antdc. For the
spelling, cf. on dehinc (79).

For the pronunciation, see on
