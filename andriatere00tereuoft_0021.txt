INTRoD UCTION 17

influences no less powerful were at work to change the char-
acter of comedy. The refinement of taste which took place
in the fourth century tended to discredit the extravagant
and often indecent burlesque of the earlier poets. The
growth of cosmopolitan feeling and the spread of interest
in the drama beyond the borders of Attica encouraged the
production of plays which did not depend for their appeal
upon familiarity with the current life of AthenS.

EURIPIDES

3. Among the strongest influences making for a change in
the comedy of the fourth century was tragedy. Greek
tragedy‚ though its characters and incidents were taken from
mythology, had always dealt with the great problems of life
which belong to every time and all lands. Not infrequently
the plays had a special bearing upon some question under
discussion at the time of their presentation. In Euripides'

' hands characters as well as problems were brought near to or-

dinarydaily life; he undertook to represent men and women
as they are. In other words, Euripidean tragedy tended to
draw nearer to the matter-of-fact atmosphere of comedy.
We choose for analysis a play which in some respects is nearer
to comedy than are most of the others -—- Iphigenia in tlte
Land of the Taurians.

The time of the play is several years after the fall of Troy.
King Agamemnon, on his victorious return from Troy, has
been slain by his wife Clytemnestra. Their son Orestes has
got vengeance by slaying his mother, and the Furies are pur-
suing him, mad with remorse, throughout the world. The

scene shows the front of a temple in the land of the TaurianS‚
on the shore of the Black Sea.l
