Propterea quod servibas liberaliter.
Quod habui summum pretium, persolui tibi.

Gaudeo,

Si. Haud muto factum.

So.

Si tibi quid feci aut facio quod placeat, Simo,

Et id gratum fuisse advorsum te habeo gratiam.

Sed hoc mihi molestumst3 nam istaec commemoratio
Quasi exprobratiost inmemori benefici.

personal pronoun had no accent;
that is, it was pronouneed as an
enclitic. Hence this phrase was
virtually a single word with a
long, and therefore accented‚
penult. Cf. adbs dum (29), and
see Introduction 18.

38. servibas = serviebas,· in
early Latin, verbs of the fourth
conjugation form the imperfect
indicative in -ibam or -iebam.
—liberaliter: “in the spirit of a
free man.''

39. pretium· = praemium. —-
persolui: the early Latin form
for persolvi.¹

40. Sosia prides himself upon
being a good and loyal servant.
In line 29 he tried to forestall a
reminder of his duty. Now the
same feeling leads him to inter-
pret Simo's rehearsal of past
kindnesses as a reproof. His
tone shows vexation. Hence
Simo's reassuring rejoinder.

42. id and the second syllable
of fuisse are shortened by the

iambic law; see Introduction 19.
—advorsumz the early form of
adversum. Advorsum te means
“before you''; translate “to
you.''—habeo gratiam, “I feel
gratitude,'’ is to be carefully dis-
tinguished from gratias ago, “I
thank you‚'' and gratiam refero,
“ I' return the favor, retaliatef'
43. hoc is shortened by the
iambic law. —molestumst -ε mo-
lestum est ,· see the next note.
44. exprobratiost = exprobratio
est,· es and est after a vowel
become 's and ’st‚ and our manu-
scripts of Plautus and Terence
often indicate that pronuncia-
tion by the spelling. When -m
precedes est the manuscripts give
such forms as molestumst (43),
although the pronunciation was
probably molestust. —- inmemori z
dative after exprobratio ,· in early
Latin, verbal nouns in -tio fre-
quently take the same construc-
tions as the verbs from which
they are formed—benefici: in
