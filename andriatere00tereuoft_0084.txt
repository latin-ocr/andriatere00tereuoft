Bene dissimulatum amorem et celatum indicat.

‘Mea Glucerium,’ inquit ‘quid agis? Cur te is perdi-

Reiecit se in eum flens quarn familiariter !

poculum, saeclum for saeculum,
etc. The diminutive suffix -cu-
lus, however, has two syllables
in early Latin, e,g.‚ aniculae,
“little old woman '’ (231),
pisciculos, “little fishes” (369).
—ibi tum: for the pleonasm,

see on 106. — exanimatus: “ ιη

133. mediam mulierem:

compare such phrases as sum-
mus mons and medio in colle.

of result.

136. quam familiariter: “how
confidingly !”

137. quid ais: this common
colloquial phrase has two
sharply distinct meanings. (1)
When, as here, it refers to a
previous remark of another
speaker it means “ What's that
you say? What?”
it refers to a subsequent re-
mark of the same speaker it
means “What do you say to
this?'’ and is merely a means
of attracting attention. In the
latter case, translate “I say.”

perfect in a past condition
