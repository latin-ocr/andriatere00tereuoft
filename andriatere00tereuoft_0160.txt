794 f. Davos means to say
that Musis was not a skillful
enough actor to help him carry
through the farce he had
planned for Cremes' benefit.
His only chance of getting
the accents of sincerity from
her was to frighten her into
telling the truth.

794. ex animo:
heart.'’

795. de industria: “by an
effort‚'' and, in this case, the
effort would have been quite
obvious if Musis had been try-
ing to play a part.

Aer IV SCENE 5

As Crito wears the cloak and
hat of a traveler‚ and as he
enters from the left, the specta-

“ frorn the

tors know at once that he has
come from abroad. His first
lines inform them that he is
the nearest living relative of
CrusiS‚ Glucerium's reputed sis-
ter. It was he, then, whose
neglect drove the poor girl
from home (71 f.). His smug
condemnation of her course
is not the more agreeable be-
cause it is so perfectly true to
life.

796. platea: Greek πλατεῖα,
“street‚'' keeps its long penult
in formal Latin plataffa. In col-
loquial Latin, however, the e
was shortened, since it stood
before a vowel, and the accent
receded to the antepenult.

797. ditias: Terence never.
uses the full form divitiae.
Between like vowels v . was
lost in rapid pronunciation and
then the two vowels contracted3
hence we have sis for si vis,
latrina for lavatrina, etc.
