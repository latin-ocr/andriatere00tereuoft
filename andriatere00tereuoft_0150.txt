146 TERENTI ANDRIA

Scio, quid consere. Da. Hoc ego tibi profecto effectum 20
reddam.

Pa. Iam hoc opus est. Da. Quin iam habeo. Ca. Quid est ?
Da: Huic, non tibi habe03 ne erres.

Sat habeo. Pa. Quid facies? Cedo.

mi ut satis sit, vereor

705 Ca. Da. Dies hic

Ad agendum; ne vocivom nunc me esse ad narrandum

credas.

Proinde hinc vos amolimin13 nam mi inpedimento estis.

Pa. Ego hanc visam.

[Exit into Glucerium's house] Da.

Quid tu? Quo hinc te agis? Ca. Verum vis
dicam? Da. Immo etiam

. 703. effectum reddam: for the
idiom, see on missum sace (680).

704. quin, “ why not? ” was
so commonly used in rhetorical
questions which amounted to
emphatic assertions, that it
came to be a corroborative
particle, “ really, indeed.''—-
ne erres: a prohibition, “ don't
make any mistake.'' ¹

705. cedo here retains its

long ultima; see on 150. Others⁴

assume that the ultima was al-
ways short in Terence's day,
and read εέιῖὸ before the diaeresis.
— ut belongs with vereor.

706. ne credas: for the con-
struction, see on ne erres (704).
— vocivom: consult the dic-
tionary under the classical form
vacuus.

707. Under the circum-
stances, Davos' insolence serves
to increase the young men’s con-
fidence in him.

708. immo etiam: the words
go closely with the following
line, and have the same un-
favorable connotation as in
line 6 5 5 3 translate f‘Worse yet !”
or better, “ That isn't the worst
of it.” ²

¹ Most scholars consider this and ne credas (706) clauses of purpose3 but
Bennett, Syntax of Early Latin 1. 168, classifies as prohibitive the closely
similar clauses in Plautus, Capt. 186, Merc. 528, and Mil. 1422. Certainly
the clause is more effective as a prohibition.

2 If one translates “yes, of course‚'' it is! hard to see why Carinus doesn't
tell his story. The same consideration makes it impossible to take the first

part of line 709 as an aside.
