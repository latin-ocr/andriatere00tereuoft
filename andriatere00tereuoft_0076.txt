TERENTI ‘ANDRIA

55 Si. Quod plerique omnes faciunt adulescentuli,
Ut animum ad aliquod sti'idium adiungam, ai'it equos
Alere ai'it canes ad venandum, ai'it ad pilosopos,
Horum ille nil egregie praeter cetera
studebat, et tamen omnia haec mediocriter.
Gaudebam. So. Non iniuri2'13 nam id arbitror
Adprime in vita esse sitile, fit ne quid nimis.
Si. Sic vita erat3 facile omnis perferre ac pati;
Cum quibus erat quomque sina, is sese dedere3

slave who conducted the chil-
dren to and from school, and
had charge of thern at home.

55. plerique omnes scarcely
differs from plerique alone.—
adulescentuli: scarcely differ-
ent from adulescentes; faded
diminutives are characteristic
of colloquial Latin.

56. ut . . . adiungant: a sub-
stantive clause of result de-
fining quod.

57. alere is in apposition
with studium, while ad pilosopos
depends directly upon animum
adiungam. The change in con-
struction is colloquial, but was
no doubt chosen here to avoid
coupling dogs and philosophers
too closely. For the spelling
of pilosopm, see on epehis (51).
For the accent, as indicated by
the ictus, see on benefici (44).

58. horum is neuter.

60. iniuria: the ablative of
manner without a modifier oc-
curs in a number of common

idioms; cf. qui, “ h0w‚” dis-
cussed in the note on line 53.

61. ut ne quid nimis: “ noth-
ing in excess ''; ut ne expresses
all that could have been ex-
pressed by the mood of the
omitted verb; we have a
substantive clause of will. The
expression is a translation of a
common Greek proverb (μηδὲν
ἄγαν) and epitomizes a very
important part of popular Greek
ethics. The freedman states
explicitly what his more culti-
vated master implied in one
word, gaudebam.

62. sic = talis is character-
istic of colloquial Latin.

63. quomque = cumque.
Early Latin retained in several
words the sound group qub‘, which
later became cu. Compare the
change of uo and vo to uu and vu
(see on parvolo, 35). This change
too was earlier in pronunciation
than in spelling. Construe quom-
que with quibus. — {s = eis.
