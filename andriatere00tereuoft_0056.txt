52 INTROD‘UCTION'

17. The most common verse in Terence is the iambic
senarius (from seni, “six apiece”), which contains six feet.
The last of these must be an iambus, but, since the final
syllable of a Latin verse may be either long or short (syllaba
anceps), the pyrrhic (υ (J) may take the place of the iambus in
this one position. Many iambic senarii, but not all of them,
have a caesura before the ictus syllable of the third or fourth

foot. The first line of the Andria (numbered 28) is to be
scanned thus:

Vos istaec intro auferte3 abite. Sosia,

-Ll-Ll ..ΑΙ υΔΙυ Lluo

To illustrate the proceleusmatic, we may analyze line 118:

Quae ibi aderant, forte unam as icio adulescentulam, ,

υ (κυΙ- L! - ΔυυόυΙ-ᾼΙυό

18. It will be observed that in line 28 each ictus except
the last falls upon a syllable that has a word accent. The
early poets preserve, to a very great extent, harmony between
verse ictus and the accent of ordinary speech. In many
cases where the two seem to clash, it is because the accent
of the Latin sentence differed considerably from the word

accent which is described in our grammarS. Thus line 29
runs:

Ades dum3 paucis te volo. Dictum puta:

Here dum is an enclitic and has the same effect upon the

accent as -que. Similarly, te volo is regularly accented on the
antepenult since the penult is short.

19. Latin words which form an iambus, such as dm5, m'e‘i,
die, fe‘r‘Z, are particularly hard for us to pronounce correctly.
The accent upon the initial short syllable makes it so diffi-

’ cult to preserve the long quantity of the final syllable that
we tend to say a'm5‚ mei, etc.
