TERENTI ‘ANDRIA

Neque commovetur animus in ea re tamen,
Scias posse habere iam ipsum suae vitae modum.
Quom id mihi placebat, tum uno ore omnes omnia

Bona dicere et laudare fortunas meas,

Qui gnatum haberem tali ingenio praeditum.

Cum dote summa filio uxorem ut daret.

Placuit ; despondi.

101. dote: the settlement of

her veil in the marriage cham-
ber. — dictust = dictus est. In

guages‚ a vowel which is pre-
ceded and followed by the same
consonant or group of conso-
nants is often lost, together with
one of the consonants or con-
sonant groups; e.g.‚ nutrix is
