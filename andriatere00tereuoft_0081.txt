ACTUS Ι, SCENA I

So, Quid igitur obstat, ci'ir non fiant ? Si. Audies,
Fere in diebus paucis, quibus haec acta sunt,

Crusis vicina haec moritur.

¹ ‘ Beasti3 metui a Cruside.

So: Ο factum bene l
Si. Ibi tum filius

Cum illis, qui amabant Crusidem, sina aderat frequens3 ‘80
Curabat sina funus ;· tristis interim,

Non numquam conlacrumabat.

of nutrio‚· semodius, “a half
peck,” is from *se[mi-]modius‚·
vendo is from *ve[nu]n-do. In
the same way dictu[s e]st loses
a syllable. Similarly we have
such forms as locutu's for lo-
cutu[s e]s (202).

103. ι cur non fiant: a relative
characterizing clause; the ante-
cedent 'of cur is quid. Trans-
late “ What’s blocking the
way so as to stop it? ''

104. fere paucis:
“ approximately within a sew
days ''; the tautology is collo-
quial—quibus is an ablative
of the time within which, used
where English idiom requires the
conjunction “ after.'' The usage
occurs in Caesar, B. G. 3. 23, pau—
cis diebus, quibus eo ventum erat,
and elsewhere; see H. 488. 3.

105. haec: said with a gesture
indicating Glucerium’s house.

106. beasti :¹ sc. me. Sosia’s
comments on the narrative ex-
press the feelings of the audience;

Placuit tfim id mihi.
for he is virtually one of them
throughout this passage. A simi-
lar role is often played by the
chorus in a Greek tragedy. —ibi
tum: both words mean ‘fthen'';
the pleonasm is colloquial. ”

107. amabant: the imperfect
instead of the more logical
pluperfect is due to the common
tendency to speak of the re-
cently dead as if they were
still alive. “ Burial will take
place from the late residence
of the deceased,’' runs the
obituary notice; but an ac-
quaintance who wants to attend
the funeral is likely to inquire,
“ Where does Mr. Blank live? ''
— frequens : an adjective,
where English idiom requires
an adverb.

109. conlacrumabat: “wept
with them.'’ 1 — tum forecasts a
time when Simo would not ap-
prove of this act3 translate “for
the moment.’' —ti‘im id: for the
scansion, see Introduction 20.

²Others think the compound is intensive, but the circumstances would
scarcely warrant bitter tears on Pampilus' part.
